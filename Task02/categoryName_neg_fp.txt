Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he\'d loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn\'t believe he\'s evil or even a miser; he\'s just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade\'s door, he doesn\'t chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade\'s deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\\"Hell isn\'t what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\\"\\"Thank God,\\" Slade responds.\\"It\'s worse,\\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \\"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\\"\\"Evil isn\'t just what you do,\\" Latham replies, \\"It\'s also what you DON\'T do.\\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man\'s life, and a man\'s effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I\'ve never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade\'s customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade\'s old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it\'s unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn\'t instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \\"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\\"\\"Humbug?\\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique", "unixReviewTime": 1224892800, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2008"}\n',

There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur\'s adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph\'s brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can\'t bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh.

They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren\'t usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don\'t waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor\'s role. But it\'s still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it\'s wrong or not. I\'ve seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph\'s brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph\'s brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph\'s scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah\'s baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \\"The Bible Collection.\\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990\'s.

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph\'s brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It\'s interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\\"Blessed be His name\\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn\'t have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob\'s life, whereas stories of Abraham\'s life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses\' time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stimulating", "unixReviewTime": 1322870400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2011"}\n',

I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \\"Elbow Room\\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \\"When He Looks at Me\\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \\"Time Stands Still\\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \\"This Land was Meant to be Free\\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \\"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \\"Cricket on the Hearth\\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming\'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, \'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio\'s Christmas, Rudolph\'s Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming\'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty\'s Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio\'s work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD.

This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It\'s narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it\'s not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A THANKSGIVING TRADITION", "unixReviewTime": 1141171200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2006"}\n',

Like all of their weekly series, Frosty was done in what is now called 2-D or cel animation. Almost all of their animation was done in Japan, and this was one completed at Mushi Studios.The animation isn\'t much more fluid than in their Animagic productions, but it works very well even by today\'s standards, in which flash is becoming so prevalent in TV cartoons. What makes it stand head and shoulders over most specials is its unerring simplicity, the voice cast (led by Jimmy Durante, Jackie Vernon and Billy DeWolfe) and the rich musical \\"house style\\" by Maury Laws. More than anything else, perhaps, the design by Paul Coker, Jr. comes across most dramatically in hand-drawn animation and makes Frosty look like a Christmas card come to life.Watching the crisp, linear Coker images (which resemble his work for countless greeting cards and especially MAD magazine) in Blu-ray is a treat. This was either beautifully preserved or painstakingly restored or both. By daughter remarked that it \\"looks like it was just made yesterday!\\"The \\"bonus\\" on the disc is Frosty Returns, the 1992 special CBS commissioned years later (though the 1974 Rankin/Bass \'Twas the Night Before Christmas special usually held the ratings in the second half hour following Frosty), was directed by \\"Peanuts\\" legend Bill Melendez. CBS may have also requested that the special resemble a \\"Peanuts\\" special because Frosty Returns looks almost identical to a show with Charlie Brown and Snoopy.Frosty Returns is notable for several reasons, including the voice of a very young Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olsen on MadMen) when she was a child actor, a witty script by Oliver Goldstick and Jim Lewis, and a nice supporting cast, especially if you\'re a SCTV and Saturday Night Live fan (the executive producer was SNL\'s Lorne Michaels, whose Broadway Video controlled the Rankin/Bass video library at the time).My only quibble is that Frosty Returns either never got the loving care in the vault as it animated predecessor or there was a mastering problem, because there is a lot of \\"line noise\\" throughout, almost as if it were a VHS tape instead of a Blu-ray! I might guess that since this show is not the main attraction, it didn\'t matter as much, but you can\'t miss the flaws when you can see the images so clearly.Other than that, Frosty the Snowman itself on Blu-ray does indeed look like it was made yesterday, rather than over 40 years ago.For more about Rankin/Bass and Frosty, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Frosty, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Frosty the Blu-ray", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}\n',

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \\"Frosty\'s Winter Wonderland\\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass \'look\'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \\"Rudolph and Frosty\'s Christmas in July\\".", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not the real Frosty sequel- see \\"Frosty\'s Winter Wonderland\\" for real sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1133827200, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2005"}\n',

It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.Produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \\"Santa Claus is Comin\' to Town\\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J.

I think of this as being a contemporary of \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin).

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children\'s living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960\'s anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting.

At least, it does after the last five minutes, when Rudolph saves everyone\'s butts from...er...fog.The story begins when Rudolph is born. To his parents\' horror, he has a flashing red nose. When Santa, the cruel despot of Christmastown (seriously -- in this show, he\'s a jerk), makes no attempt to hide his disgust, Rudolph\'s father, Donner, displays some dubious parenting techniques by forcing the young deer to disguise his luminous snout. Unfortunately, Rudolph\'s shameful deformity is discovered by the other young reindeer, who laugh and call him names. One of these cretins is named Fireball - he\'s got a single wisp of blond hair and freckles, so he really shouldn\'t be one to talk.When Rudolph is cast out from Christmastown, he meets some new friends:Hermey - a toy-hating elf with an oral fixation, and a finger-wave hairdo that would make Conan O\'Brien jealous. Hermey loses his job because he wants to live an alternate lifestyle. How PC.Yukon Cornelius - a burly prospector seeking to increase his personal wealth. Interestingly, he carries a gun. Yukon helps Rudolph defeat a giant snow-monster. The monster (who is white) represents The Man, crushing anyone who does not bow to conformity (by staying safely in Christmastown).Misfit Toys - a bunch of toys that nobody wants: a boat that doesn\'t float, a train with square wheels, a squirt-gun filled with jelly, etc. Frankly, I think Santa\'s workshop needs better Quality Control, if they\'re turning out junk like this. Besides, I can think of a few seventh graders who could make the most of a jelly-gun.Clarice - a doe-eyed...well...doe, with Revlon lashes and a bow in her hair. She\'s lovely and tolerant, and the most under-developed character in the story.While this enchanting tale is a family-favorite it fails as an origin story, neglecting to explain why Rudolph\'s nose glows. It\'s obviously a genetic mutation, but we never learn the mechanism behind it. Does it give off heat? Why does it make that feeble whistling sound? Is it any more horrifying than the fact that Santa can go from skinny to fat in the course of one day?It\'s also disconcerting that, by story\'s end, Rudolph has reached maturity (with tall, pointed antlers), but his voice has not changed. Perhaps reindeer puberty is unpredictable, but Rudolph is the only adult male who doesn\'t sound like J. Jonah Jameson.Still, I recommend this Claymation Classic for anyone.

Although the company made quite a few feature films over the years, with the 1967 THE MAD MONSTER PARTY probably the best known, they were most famous for their seasonal television specials.  These included the 1964 RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, which has been televised on network television every year at Christmas since its debut.Obviously inspired by the song by the 1939 song, the story veers in several creative directions.  Not only does Rudolph have a glowing red nose, his father attempts to conceal it, and even Santa rejects Rudolph because of it.  This story line is combined with the tale of elf Hermey, who dislikes making toys and wants to be a dentist.  Rejected for who they are, Rudolph and Hermey flee the north pole--and eventually stumble upon the Island of Misfit Toys, where unwanted toys are gathered and will remain until some little girl or boy actually wants one of them.  Still later, the pair encounter Yukon Cornelius, who helps them defeat the \\"Bumble,\\" a version of the abominable snowman.  Rudolph and Hermey return home, where both now find acceptance; Yukon Cornelius joins them, leading the Bumble, who he has converted into a helpful beast.  When a violent snow storm threatens to postpone Christmas, Rudolph uses his nose to light Santa\'s way, and after a quick stop to pick up the misfit toys for a happily-ever-after Christmas delivery, Santa is on his way.The stop-motion is hardly on the same level as that of KING KONG or EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but it has a certain innocent charm, and the puppets are truly smile inducing.  The show also includes a number of truly enjoyable Christmas songs, two of which are performed by Burl Ives as the narrating snowman and which went on to a broader popularity: \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" and \\"Sliver and Gold.\\"  The DVD release is not pristine, but it is extremely good, and children of all ages will enjoy the show.

The sound on this new edition may be slightly better than that of the previous disc (which warbled badly in a few spots), but it\'s still far from perfect.  The picture quality is very good, considering the age of the film.  Special features include: animated menus, the Rudolph trivia game, the \\"Fame &amp; Fortune\\" song (which replaced the original \\"We\'re a Couple of Misfits\\" in 1965), a short TV promo (not very exciting), and a ten-minute introduction by Arthur Rankin.  Said introduction is somewhat informative, but I would have appreciated a more detailed explanation of how the \\"Animagic\\" process is done.  Another feature on this disc, called \\"ReadSpeak\\", is an innovative new captioning method which, when selected on the menu screen, shows written words coming out of the characters\' mouths as they talk, thereby helping kids learn to read.  And don\'t miss the Pilsbury cookie dough commercial at the start of the feature!  In closing, if you don\'t own \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" on DVD, don\'t hesitate to pick this one up (it\'s not Christmas without Rudolph, right?).  But, if you already have the previous version in your collection, you might want to save your money.  Aside from the great new photo cover, the special features here really aren\'t all that impressive (and how they add up to a 135-minute total running time is beyond me).

Written by Robert L. May and directed by Kizo Nagashima and Larry Roemer, \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" is just as engaging and entertaining for children today as it was when it was first released in 1964.  The story is about a young reindeer named Rudolph (voice by Billie Mae Richards) who is teased and jaunted by other reindeer because he has a glowing red nose instead of a little black nose like every other reindeer.  Seeing himself as a misfit, he decides to run away and is joined by an elf named Hermey (voice by Paul Soles).  Hermey also considers himself a misfit because he wants to be dentist instead of a toy-maker like the other elves.  They meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (voice by Larry D. Mann), unwanted toys on the Island of Misfit Toys, it\'s lion king named King Moonracer (voice by Stan Francis) and the scary abominable snowman.  Other characters include the young reindeer Clarice (voice by Janet Orenstein), her father (voice by Paul Kligman), Comet the coach (voice by Paul Kligman), Santa Claus (voice by Stan Francis), the Head Elf (voice by Alfie Scopp), Charlie-in-the-Box (voice by Carl Banas) and a spotted elephant (voice by Carl Banas).  The story is also narrated by Sam the Snowman, whose voice was done by Burl Ives (1909-1995).Songs in this adorable children\'s fantasy include:* \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* \\"Jingle Jingle Jingle\\" (5 stars, performed by Santa Claus).* \\"We Are Santa\'s Elves\\" (5 stars, performed by Santa\'s elves.)* \\"There\'s Always Tomorrow\\" (5+ stars, performed by Clarice.)* \\"We\'re A Couple of Misfits\\" (5 stars, performed by Rudolph and Hermey.)* \\"Fame and Fortune\\" (4.5 stars, performed by Rudolf and Hermey.)* \\"Silver and Gold\\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* \\"The Most Wonderful Day of the Year\\" (4.5 stars, performed by the misfit toys.)* \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)Overall, I rate \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" with 5 out of 5 stars.

When it started everybody just shut up. It got interesting from the begining when Jesus starts praying in the garden and Judas betrays him. In the parts where I almost cover my eyes where on the part of the whips and chains and those things. The part where he carries the cross was one of the saddest things for me.Now we\'ll talk about the performances. The best performance in the movie was Caviezel\'s. He was the best Christ I\'ve ever seen in movies. He looked so much like the Jesus. I think the best actor who played Christ. Then there is Mary, Jesus\'s mother. Did you know that the actress who played the Virgin Mary is Juish ? Her expressions were very well done. Her sadness was  incomparable. She is one of the best actress I\'ve seen to this day. Then there is Satan. I do not know who the hell (haha) plays Satan, but she/he (I think it\'s a SHE) plays the part very...coldly, very...frightening. Good performance too.The movie itself was TOOOOOO violent. It\'s the same story, but the last twelve hours of Christ, but expressed in a very explict graphic and violent scenes. I bet you know more than two people died of watching Jesus being beat up with whips and chains and weapons. I didn\'t enjoy that at all. The performances were uncomparable. This movie is the most famouis R-rated movie of all times, I think you do not know that, but there are always some exceptions. It is one of the movies that you feel like you don\'t wanna see twice.There was also tons of strange stuff that happened during the making of the movie, I think most of you know, but for those who do not know I\'ll mention some of them below.When James Caviezel was crucified, I lightning stroke on his right shoulder. They had to stop the filming until he had to get better. Then, on the scenes in which he carries the cross he dislocates his shoulder (I don\'t remember which one it was) and they had to stop the filming for another three to six weeks. Then there was the part in the movie where Jim is taken to see some guy who looked weird that had make-up and a wig (I do not remember who that was) and when that guy spoke his lines from the script, he said other strange stuff he didn\'t wanna say and he had no control of it. Freaky, I know. At the part of the whipping, Jim Caviezel obviously pretended to be taken the hits, except three or four, some of those times when Caviezel was being hit with whips, they really hit him in the back a couple of times. In an interview, Caviezel explained that and he said he felt what Jesus himself felt when he was being punished. There were much more strange things that happened but I think if you buy this WIDESCREEN or FULLSCRENE edition DVD, I think if you access the SPECIAL FEATURES menu, then there should be some intervies in which Caviezel explains everythink.Buy this DVD or the FULLSCREEN formate. There are no different except on the screen, obviously. I am not that kind of a person in which likes to watch Jesus getting punished.

After reading up on the events of Jesus\' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson\'s purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the \\"4 questions\\" that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: \\"Why is this night different than all other nights?\\"If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it\'s not always easy to keep track of who\'s who or what they\'re doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate\'s decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests\' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn\'t see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it.

In my opinion, no.  Blame Herod, who is at all times righteous, unbending, fixated on Jesus\' technical violations of Hebraic codes and totally hypocritical when viewed against his son\'s sybaritic, Romanized and decadent lifestyle -- truly a Pharisee!  But the film\'s plotwork:  the New Testament book of Mark, Chapters 14 through end, with flashbacks to Chapter 13, give us sufficient motivation to the Herod character by mentioning his \\"envy\\" of Jesus--surely that \\"envy\\" could only be spiritual and not material or political, except political-by-indirection?  The other two Synoptic Gospels, Matthew and Luke, enhance the motif.Also, Gibson\'s film portrays not so much \\"the mob,\\" \\"the crowd,\\" \\"the Jews,\\" or what other popular English-language bible translations have calling for Jesus\' crucifixion after Barabbas\' release; rather, the film clearly shows Pilate offering the option that Jesus be spared or executed after physical chastisement and Herod himself specifically calling for His crucifixion and then, the heavy majority (but NOT all) of those gathered chiming in.Perhaps the film can be gently blamed for over-sympathizing with the Romans, but the pendulum swung both ways.  The centurions and soldiers charged with whipping Jesus were clearly a sadistic lot who specialized in torture and crucifixion, ogre-like in appearance, with heavy broad noses and dark brown eyes.  (They both looked and acted subhuman.)  On the other hand, and I think Gibson is using Italian racial sub-typing to his advantage, the common soldiers whose task it was to accompany Christ to Golgotha, while keeping away the locals who wanted a piece of Him, had more clearly Piedmontese features, aquiline noses and hazel eyes.An excellent Eastern Bloc actor played Pontius Pilate and invested the character with a great deal of sympathy by means of \\"close acting\\" that showed the dilemma Pilate was in:  the necessity of practical politics overriding the desirability of treating Jesus in a more humane, common-sense manner (at least according to Roman  AD 30 standards).  In one of the few additions to material not found in Matthew, Mark or Luke; Lydia, Pilate\'s wife, brings several clean white-linen pieces of cloth to Mary and Mary Magdalene.  We, the largely Christian audience, know that these will become relics.Was THE PASSION OF CHRIST violent?  In a B-movie sense, meaning gratuitous brawling and blood-letting, no.  It was true to the text in that it portrayed the last 12 hours of Jesus\' life in a graphic, literarily \\"ash-can\\" Naturalistic fashion, right down to the maggots crawling out of the head of a dead donkey within Judas\' vision as he slumps against a tree in terror.  (Judas never has a moment\'s peace after he tries to return the thirty coins to Herod.)  So while THE PASSION was not violent, it was gruesome; but it was gruesome within the bounds of what the Bible tells us took place.  Perhaps nationally-syndicated film critic Roger Ebert said it best when he said that only Mel Gibson\'s standing within the movie industry let this film be branded an \\"R\\" instead of an \\"NC-17.\\"Should \\"Mainline\\" or \\"Liberal\\" Protestants like Methodists, Lutherans or Presbyterians see this film?  YES!  Why not, if they\'ve a mind to?  Avoiding this film out of mere squeamishness would merely validate the stereotype that \\"Establishment\\" believers are a bunch of comfortable wishy-washies who are all for confronting the realities of life, death and poverty--as long as we subsidize it and someone else does the job of facing the actual ickies.I learned a lot from this film.  Personally, it was cathartic as well as riveting.  Interestingly, as with most people at the cinema, what provoked the tears was not so much the cruelty but the response along the lines of \\"Do you REALIZE what you\'re DOING and to WHOM?\\".  Because everybody killed Jesus.  And everybody is capable of killing God and killing us, too.  Roman Catholic doctrine such as the veneration of Mary and Imitatio Dei were opened up to me in ways I\'d never understood before.Personally, I urge anyone with the slightest interest to see THE PASSION OF CHRIST, and not to write it off as some spiritual howler meant only as a sock to the jaw for the most hard-headed kind of R.C.\'s or Evangelical Protestants in buses.

Sadly, all that remains is remembrance of the extreme violence.  I remember nothing about the man, nothing about his message, nothing about what he did.  All I remember are the scenes of blood and gore.  That isn\'t really a judgment as the film was intended to be a no-holds-barred rendering of the final hours of his life.I do remember that the cinematography is phenomenal and the score quite haunting.  As a film, it is powerful.  The film has something of a mystical, other-worldly feel to it and the flashback sequences do provide some grounding (and relief) from the overall achingly somber tone of the film.Without resorting to theological nitpicking, it seems to me that there was little to chew on for those who may not be coming from a Christian backround.  I come from a Christian background and was not enthralled with the film.  I felt as if I should have been deeply moved by the film but, in fact, I generally find myself with the minority opinion among Christian believers.It was appalling violence inflicted upon one man but I simply failed to make the connection within the context of the film for such treatment.

From a hopeful point of view it renders one to conclude that perhaps differing denominations can truly be one body; the cynic says that ultimately we are just opportunists.  But he has put it all out there on the table.  Like him or not, like the film or not, it is kind of hard to ignore.As a film, it is powerful and well worth watching at least once.

I know the Stations of the Cross as well as anyone who grew up Catholic, and I know the Gospels as well any Baptist. However, like Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert, I was connected with the reality of the suffering Christ went through in a very real way. It is just a movie, and the guy on the cross wasn\'t Jesus. But it caused me to think about Jesus in a whole new way.I knew this was coming. I have read dozens of articles on this and tuned into every show on the movie. Not good enough. It still hit me. It wasn\'t the blood that spattered on my face, but the love that spattered on my heart. I sat in that theater as a Christian who believes, but I experienced something very heavy that evening. There is no separating my Christian beliefs from my reaction to the movie.The subtitles take nothing from the experience, and add to the focus on the movie\'s story rather its dialogue.The beginning sets the dramatic tone, delivering us into the Garden of Gesthemene as Jesus prays. Judas kisses him softly on the cheek, and a fight ensues between the posse of soldiers and Jesus\' disciples. Jesus himself waits, and even heals the ear wounded by Peter, whom Jesus rebukes. The following events include a trial and flogging. Jesus never raises a hand or comment against his accusers, nor does he deny their accusations that he claims to be God. Pilate is torn politically, wanting to do the right thing and wanting to save his own position. Unwilling to assert a position, he lays the call onto the town\'s citizen who are in a blood-frenzy.What grabbed me in the movie were unexpected scenes, like Jesus and Mary connecting sight on the Via Dolorosa. Jesus stumbles, and the movie flashes back to Mary running to a four year old Jesus who stumbled in a field. She picks him up, holds him motherly. Now, Jesus is 33, all battered and worn from a vicious, sadistic abuse by Roman soldiers. Mary runs to him. He speaks to her, whispering cryptically, \\"See mother, I make all things new,\\" and does his best to press on. It is his cross to carry, and he raises to his feet.The ending is ingeniously subtle. In some ways, they are the 30 most important seconds of the movie in which it all comes together. Every drop of blood, every rejected silver piece, and every cross-dragged furrow in the road to Golgotha comes together in probably the most understated yet complete climax to a movie I have ever seen.I understand now why people bought tickets for friends, dragged people to see it. I expected to be blown away, but I didn\'t expect to be hit at my core on so many different levels.The movie isn\'t perfect. Some scenes took more poetic license than can be historically supported. Herod was decadently different than I expected, and perhaps the least like the real Herod. Herod\'s lascivious persona here matches the essence, if not the exact personality. His reactions to the Christ situation were consistent with the Bible, and add texture to Pilate\'s dilemma.Some vague scenes confused me, like when Satan carries a grimacing, sneering man-child. However, as Satan\'s gender is not important to his evil nature, the androgyny holds up.A knowledge of Christian scripture will augment an understanding of the film\'s secondary flashback scenes. The movie does stand on its own, and meets the vision of its controversial director. Whether the audience is a devout believer, or seeing the movie as an artistic portrayal of history\'s most influential figure, the movie will work. I expect it to be rerun in theaters every Easter season.I fully recommend this movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cataclysmic, Profound Movie Bigger Than Controversy", "unixReviewTime": 1078704000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2004"}\n',

We finally went to see the controversial Mel Gibson portrayal of the last day of Jesus life (the events of that day are commonly called \\"The Passion\\").Here are some of my thoughts:* Not nearly as violent as Saving Private Ryan, or any number of other movies featuring cinematic \\"realism\\" today.  Having said that, there is no way around it, this is a violent film, but I don\'t think an NC-17 is justified in this case as suggested by some film critics.The thing is, for hundreds of years the death of Christ as occurring in a crucifixion has been so sterilized that people (I\'m talking to Christians mostly) attribute a kind of Santa Claus or Easter Bunny mythology to what Jesus went through.  This portrays the crucifixion accurately from a realistic standpoint verified by the Journal of the American Medical Association. (The Journal of the American Medical Association, March 21, 1986, Volume 256).* Accurate to the biographical record written by two eye witnesses to Jesus-- Matthew and John; and one historian-- Luke, and the record probably dictated to Mark by Peter.  The film is based on these historical records, commonly called the Gospels. From my viewpoint as a guy with a degree in Bible and Theology, they closely follow the events.Obviously there is some cinematic license taken to make an interesting screenplay, but even in those moments I felt the film was true to the spirit of the records.* Anti-Semitic?  I don\'t think so. There were several criticisms leveled against the film.  One was that Jews were always shown in a poor light.  That is not true. While the key leaders that brought Jesus to trial were accusing him and probably inciting their people in order to get a death sentence, it is accurate to the biographical record.Having said that, it is most important to note: Outside of the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, every person portrayed was a Jew.  At no time did Jesus or any of his followers call for any kind of judgment against the Jewish leadership.  Plus, at least two of the Jewish leaders were clearly shown to support Jesus.  Additionally, Jesus was a Jew, as was his mother, all his followers and every person supporting and sympathizing with him.Following the crucifixion the Bible clearly shows his followers stayed active in the local Jerusalem temple. (cf: Acts 2; Acts 3). They remained Jewish, and actively maintained their temple worship for at least several years. To say the film is anti-Semite is to say it calls judgment on Jesus followers.* \\"His blood be on us and our children\\" is a famous line in the gospels and critics cry out that this line alone is enough to incite violence against Jews. However it does not appear in the current film version (unless it is an untranslated line in Aramaic or Hebrew).  This line is one of the great and beautiful ironies of the gospels. Matthew 27:24-26 presents these words as the crowd calls for Jesus crucifixion. The irony is while it seems that people-leaders are reckless calling a curse or judgment on themselves for Jesus death, the truth is that is exactly what allows all people to enjoy the extended forgiveness and favor with God. The Bible clearly teaches it is Jesus blood that is the means to forgiveness.  The blood is the vehicle of mercy, not judgment.* Jon Voight incorrectly cites film techniques employed by Nazi\'s in the 1930s.  Actor and director, Jon Voight this week on CNBC and MSNBC implied that Gibson used techniques designed to vilify Jews. He stated frames of Jews were interspersed with frames of demonic figures, suggesting these are a means to demonify Jews.Voight needs to see the film again and take another look.  The instances where this took place were as Judas was in the process of his betrayal subsequently overwrought with the guilt of his actions.  He was clearly demonized (rightly so) and some images were clearly hallucinated. In another scene you see a demonic figure with the satan-character.  You never one time see a demonic figure linked to any Jewish leader or person of any prominence.* You should read the biographies (gospels) of Jesus life before seeing this film-- or certainly after you see it. The film can stand for itself as a piece of cinematic art, however it assumes you are very familiar with the history of Jesus life, and hopefully the prophetic Jewish writings of the Old Testament that are a setting for the coming of a \\"Messiah\\" that would save all people from sins. Each biography presents the life of Jesus from a different viewpoint. However, if you do not have any background in the Bible, you might want to read a \\"synoptic\\" version--one that has incorporated all four biographies into one chronological record also called a \\"harmony of the gospels\\".A free copy of one of these is available online called the \\"Book of Hope\\".

Jesus was a Jewish man in a Jewish nation with Jewish followers.  Some of his countrymen loved him, some hated him, and some were ambivalent.  Gibson very clearly shows this, as anyone can see who pays attention to the action.  As well, some of the Romans are sadistic brutes, and some are decent people reluctantly carrying out duties.

However, I think Gibson tries to focus on the purpose of His suffering.  Satan (wonderfully protrayed as a mocking amorphous being) confronts Christ in the garden and tells him that NO ONE MAN can take on the sins of the world  - and that\'s why such a display of violence: each lash, each drop of blood, each thorn, each nail, is sin upon sin visited upon Him so that Man would not suffer separation from God.

But \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" stirs even more emotions, the most salient of which are anger, shock, and melancholy.  By tapping into the primary art medium of our time, the darkest slice of Christ\'s biography, his torture and execution at the hands of Jewish clergy and Roman authority, has once again asserted itself as the most influential story ever told.Opening in a Gethsemane bathed in blue light, director Mel Gibson quickly introduces one of his innovations, an androgynous and Druidic Satan figure who will flit through the rest of the narrative, appearing even on the via dolorosa carrying some sort of mutant child.Overall, however, the film is faithful, perhaps even excessively faithful, to the canonical gospel accounts of Christ\'s last hours.  It strives for realism enough to allow its characters to speak Latin and Aramaic, revealing Jesus\' name as \\"Yehosua,\\" but it presents the miraculous as well:  Christ restoring a man\'s sliced ear or the temple cracking in half as the moment of Christ\'s death.  Most significantly, it presents the resurrection of Christ in a brief and artful scene in which he disappears from his tunic, which fluffs and falls, reconstituting himself as unblemished except for the holes of his stigmata.But Jesus is hardly unblemished through most of the film.  Unless you\'ve moved into the rathole vacated by Saddam Hussein, you\'re aware that this 2004 film offers the most graphic presentation of Jesus\' suffering in any Christ film yet.  His torturers are far more sadistic than in \\"King of Kings\\" or \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\"  The scene of Christ\'s scourging has quickly become a conversation piece as the movie rules the box office.  Most of the Romans who administer the scourging are vicious thugs who seem to relish the destruction of a body.  Choosing a whip whose hooks tear flesh from bone, they render Jesus a bloody pulp from head to toe, exposing spongy subdermal layers and even a few ribs.  By the time the actual crucifixion occurs, we see an elbow bone poking through skin as well.  The first nail is driven in with a geyser of blood.This is not, however, gratuitous violence.  The suffering here is the point.  It is a statement and a sacrifice in the mind of the one suffering and his two billion believers.  Actually, Mel Gibson pulls his punches in a few places, since crucifixion involved asphyxiation and baking in the sun, neither of which isdepicted in \\"The Passion.\\"The acting and direction are solid, even excellent in \\"The Passion the Christ,\\" but the real star here is an ace cinematographer.  Certain visuals are seared on your brain after seeing \\"The Passion.\\"  These include the unctuous eyebrow-less devil with his mutant baby, the scenes of the two Marys taking linen and mopping what looks like gallons of Jesus\' blood from around the scourging post, and the scene which finally brought tears:  As she watches her son fall with his cross, Mary remembers him falling as a little boy.  Maternal concern written all over her face, she runs to pick him up.  But 30 years later as she approaches her son, she is unable to aid him, only watch the gruesome spectacle.  His hair stringy, his face covered in blood and sweat, he assures her:  \\"See!  I make everything new!\\"Was anyone ever so misunderstood as Christ?  So many in the film from Pilate to Caiaphas just don\'t comprehend that Christ doesn\'t seek power in the material world but would rather direct our eyes to a simmering mirage on a distant dune, the lifeforce around and within us, the everlasting spirit that will survive our bodies whose oxygen addiction will prove fatal in 80 years.  Mutiple and brief flashbacks to the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper feature a robust charismatic Jesus, but perhaps these are too brief and too few as some have complained.  They might have been increased and lengthened to create a more effective counterpoint to the story\'s endless gore.Still, even this complaint may arise from discomfort with massive human suffering.  Doesn\'t a person with advanced HIV symptoms suffer like this?  How about a person standing near a Palestinian suicide bomber or withering in a Serbian death camp?

Of course, a couple of the GOOD guys were Jewish, too -- not to mention the fact that many of the bad guys were Romans, not Jews. In truth, the movie is more anti-moron than anything.

The scourging and crucifixion of Jesus is pretty brutal, but it\'s counter-balanced by Jim \\"Angel Eyes\\" Caviezel\'s excellent moaning. That makes you feel pretty bad for Jesus.

Jesus even has holes in his hands from the crucifix, which will cut down wind-resistance when he pimp-slaps evil. It\'s pretty cool -- I\'m hoping Gibson decides to make a sequel, like \\"The Passion 2: Operation Stranglehold\\" or something.In truth, the most impressive thing about \\"the Passion of the Christ\\" was the marketing.

The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ\'s life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel\'s cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney\'s engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus\'s life, he\'s not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film\'s budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \\"R\\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn\'t see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you\'re very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus\'s hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus\'s body is drenched with blood.  There\'s also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.

Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here.  First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film.  He could have contented himself making \\"Lethal Weapon\\" sequels and \\"What Women Want\\", films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance.  To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage.  As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres.  The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity.  There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity.  This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before.  As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus.  He does not so much capture Christ\'s divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson\'s than the actor\'s.  Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus\' mother.  Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son.  Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate.  I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here.  There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative.  On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson.  Gibson included a commentary on the \\"Braveheart\\" DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it\'s kind.  My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Will Gibson\'s Version Stand the Test of Time?", "unixReviewTime": 1093996800, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2004"}\n',

I was speechless when I watched this film.  People are making such a big deal out of this:  the content, all the controversy from the news and people\'s gossip, Mel Gibson\'s direction.  I hardly heard about this film until just a few weeks, so I felt like watching this film, cause it looked really interseting to see and know what\'s the hype about it. I have to say, this movie really is...\\"interesting.\\"The Passion of the Christ isn\'t really about the life of Jesus Christ, but just the outcome of him.  It took place in the last 12 hours of Jesus\'s life in Jerusalem.  One of his desciples, Judas, betrayed Jesus, played by James Caviezel, and was captured by a strong religious group known as Pharisees at the Garden of Olives.  After being accused as a blasphemer to many, Jesus was then chastised to painful whippings, all then leading to the unforgettable, the crucifixion.  During it all, Jesus tries to \\"not lead him to temptation, but to deliver him from evil\\", ala, Satan.  Also during his torturing, there are some arbitrary-yet-significant back stories that further displays the life of Jesus: being as a carpenter, delivering the message of God to his people, and delivering the last supper of his disciples.  Again, Wow!  Mel Gibson should\'ve renamed this title, The Torture of the Christ, but people say to me that the word \\"Passion\\" meant \\"Suffering\\" at a certain degree.  Let me comprehend this: Jesus has gotten spit at, beaten up, whipped, shredded, piercied, and any painful way he went through that not ever the most durable of S&M; freaks can endure...so all that suffering was passion?  Thank You, Mel Gibson, now I don\'t want any kind of pleasure after this.Wow!  Critics say this movie is graphic, but I didn\'t expect this movie would be THAT graphic!  The blood, the abuse and torture...excuse me, the \\"passion\\" that happen to the Son of God for whole 126 minutes, not even all of Nine Inch Nails\' uncut music videos I\'ve seen would hold a candle to this movie.  I believe Gibson knew what he was getting into, and that\'s how he wanted it, so I applaud for him directing this film.  He focused all his past works as an anti-heroic actor, and tries to use it to display the hardship and sorrow of this film, and it made this film work.  The well-done direction gives new perspection on the Son of God.  I see Jesus bleeding, scarred, scabbed, and ostracized, heck, even the Pharisees rather free a murderer than a blasphemer like him, but he knew the future bleeks him, and he would still deliver the words from God to the people.  Even when people around him wanted to see him executed, he loved and forgiving those who has yet to understand God\'s words.  He would even put his soul in vain to repent for the sins the people created.  It made me realize that it\'s not the Jews that are responsible for the death of Jesus, but mankind is responsible.  We take our lives for granted, and he sold his life for us knowing that, and I felt like I could\'ve done better with my own life since Jesus risked his \\"passionate\\" life for people like me to have a better one.The Passion of the Christ has one of the best cinematographies around.  The ways it showed Jesus\'s suffering in slow-motion, giving it a more dramatic feel, and how the characters expressed about this whole entity.  It\'s hard to explain in detail about the cinematography of this film, but to put it short, it made the experience felt more real.  For authenticity\'s sake, the characters speak only in Aramaic language, so whether people like or not, this movie\'s in subtitles.  If there is one serious flaw this movie has, I think that it just wasn\'t completely realized.  I may not have read the Holy Bible, but there\'s gotta be more than just Jesus experience the outcome.  It was suppose to send a message to his people after he died and adore him for his sacrifice, and yet after he died, his soul just walked towards heaven and the movie\'s over.  That\'s that, the message that was suppose to deliver in this movie was nonexistant, and it made me suffer, not only emotionally, but somewhat intellectually.This movie really creep me out, but at the same time, I was really involved with it, and I couldn\'t believe that I was so involved with a biblical film.  The Passion of the Christ isn\'t everyone\'s cup of red wine with a side of crackers.  People who\'re religiously-involved, wanting to know more about Jesus, or just weak-hearted by its graphic content might not enjoy this movie so much.  It doesn\'t made me change my mind about reading the holy bible as an interest, but it was the best depicition on Jesus\'s life I\'ve seen since those lousy TV specials.  It may have been controversial to some degree, but people should watch this movie because it\'s just subliminally engaging.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Passion = Suffering?", "unixReviewTime": 1077667200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2004"}\n',

But in the actual movie (a film about the voluntary sacrifice of Christ) I found nothing of that sort. Beyond all lesser contexts of tribe, kin or creed, the story contained in PASSION is the far more universal Eternal Drama, that of MAN destroying the best thing that is his, namely the possibility of opening his eyes and seeing change, seeing a way in life to be less violent. We crucify the Truth now today as we always have; with metaphorical stones we continually \\"kill\\" and suppress people and ideas.Why, in the Drama of Christ did Judas even need to \'betray\' Jesus before they crucified him? The authorities could have found Jesus without much trouble, so Judas\' action makes no sense except for its symbolic meaning. That meaning is: Christ (through Judas) handed himself over to the baser men who could not see what he was, and (if you review the last supper) Jesus essentially commanded Judas to help him. That is missing in Gibson\'s presentation, although the spiritual suffering Judas must have willingly undertook to play his role is itself portrayed as a horror for any man to endure. But for what purpose, what result? The crucifixion was necessary, fully intended... and at the moment Christ says \\"it is done\\" before slouching down on the cross, we realize something has been done TO the men who brought him there, ie. some deep frightening realization of themselves has been touched. This moment is for all of us, and the effect of the event has not gone away.A very thoughtful film overall. We are made to experience the viscerality of Christ\'s especially fervent subjection to suffering (and why such fervor?) not just through gory makeup and effects, but equally through the depths of psychic pain we see in the faces of Mary his mother, and his devoted Magdelen. I was never so utterly moved contemplating the event of Christ\'s death. And never so surprised and elated by the event to follow!Just see it. It is hard to talk about this film apart from it\'s meaning in Christ\'s teaching and life, things themselves very layered in meaning.

I know he was bloodied and beatened but there was something about him that made me want to be near him.Also as well, I want to point out Rosalinda Celentano\'s performance as Satan. I found her both frightening but beautiful at the same time. Some of the visuals regarding her deeply disturbed me but I found her fascinating due to the fact she was androgynous. My father could not tell if she was male or female. I\'d honestly like to see her in more things.Another thing that captivated me was the way it was shot and the musical score. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of cinematography and setting. It felt so authentic. The music was definately moving. It sounds so ethereal and otherworldly but also adding to the film\'s experience.But over all, this was a film that was highly brutal,deeply moving, an experience and disturbing all at once.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brutal..", "unixReviewTime": 1094342400, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2004"}\n',

It is not typical movie \\"loosely based on\\" anything, which usually means there are some true parts and some fake parts.  This film follows the Bible completely and is therefore a wonderful teaching tool and extremely powerful experience.What I loved most about The Passion, was that it gave me something I\'d never had in church.  I\'ve read the Bible, I\'ve paid attention in Sunday School and Church and I know what Jesus did for me when He died so that I might be saved.  On a CEREBRAL level and with my faith, I know it and believe it.  However, this film gave me a solid VISUAL that grabbed my heart and brought it in line with my mind and faith.  Knowing & believing is one thing.  But to see with my own eyes how much Jesus loved me is an experience which I will always cherish.  I believe it will do this for you.Yes, there is a tremendous amount of violence.  And quite frankly, I find it funny that people in THIS country (USA), home of the murderous villians responsible for the almost total genocide of Native Indians and the kidnapping, rape, enslavement and death of Blacks for over 300 years, would have the audacity to pretend they are shocked by the violence of the film.  I attribute this to the hypocritical nature of people in the US who are so desperate to remove GOD from everything (except the money, of course), that they would even dane to complain about violence in a movie; sort of like Mike Tyson complaining about someone pinching him.  What you see in this film is what actually happened.  And you NEED to see that to have a full understanding of what Jesus suffered and WHY.There were sniffles throughout the theatre during the film and I had to grab a tissue or two myself.  However, when the first nail is driven into His hand, that\'s when I broke down and truly experienced feelings of being completely unworthy of the sacrifice, yet thankful that He was willing to give His life in such a way for me.  This also marked the first time I\'d seen a film where NO ONE jumped up at the end.  Everyone sat and had to recover before moving from their seat. Powerful!If nothing else, the film The Passion of the Christ should truly teach you how to forgive.  For, as Jesus was beaten to within an inch of His life, nailed to the cross, hung, bled and prepared to die, He still spoke out \\"Father, FORGIVE Them For They Know Not What They Do\\".Kinda puts that whole \\"she cut me off on the highway and now I want her dead\\" thing into perspective, doesn\'t it?Dr. Braxy :o)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful Is A Soft Word To Describe This One!", "unixReviewTime": 1083196800, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2004"}\n',

Instead, we have a vivid, shocking picture that you won\'t be able to forget.This is, in essence, a cinematic passion play: We are shown Jesus\'s (Jim Caviezel) temptation by a surprisingly eerie Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), and his arrest by the Romans. His apostles flee away, leaving his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern), follower Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) to follow him on the road to where he would be crucified...&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was one of the unexpected hits of the last year -- it had a tiny budget, a seemingly small fanbase, and was made strictly according to the Catholic New Testament. But it struck a chord in people -- not just the subject matter, but the fact that Gibson was so dedicated. Much to Hollywood\'s surprise, people raced to see the controversial flick.While some accuse Gibson of revelling in the gore, with a little bit of thought his &quot;Passion&quot;\'s point comes through. It\'s horrifying to imagine a person -- let alone an incarnate god -- going through such horrors. But when it is realized what the point of all that suffering was for, it becomes a work of beauty. The biggest problem would be that Gibson spent little time on the idea of Jesus being resurrected, which was the whole point.Jim Caviezel gives a stunning performance as Jesus Christ. Whether it\'s trying to pray through Satan\'s prattling or speaking to Mary and John from the cross, Caviezel brings every scene to life. Morgenstern is low-key wonderful as the sorrowful mother who has to watch her son killed by inches. And the beautiful Belucci is equally outstanding as the horrified Magdalene.Yes, it\'s in Aramaic and Latin. But if the language doesn\'t hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through. And Gibson\'s direction is equally stunning, utilizing rapid camerawork and plenty of flashbacks to make Jesus\'s struggle even more poignant. At times -- the table scene -- it\'s more than slightly awkward. But it\'s easy to forget that by the next scene.It\'s a shock. It\'s a controversy. It\'s a one-of-a-kind film, based on a part of our culture that was underrated by Hollywood.

It has been claimed to include non-stop strong images of graphic violence, and it has been claimed not to show enough of the teachings of Jesus Christ. To me, all of those three things are not in the movie. The films shows nothing about blaming the Jews for the death to Christ, it showed enough violence for us to know how Jesus must how felt, and it showed enough of the teachings of Christ to show how good he was in his life. \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" was directed by Mel Gibson, and it is not only one of the best films of the year, but it is also one of the most provoking, thoughtfeld film of the year. It is about the final twelve hours of Jesus Christ\'s life. People claim that the film has too much violence, but if you think about, the final twelve hours of Christ\'s life was a very violent few hours. Mel Gibson is only trying to show us what Christ went through to save our sins. The movie has beautiful scenery, and I believe it was filmed in Rome. There wasn\'t that many sets, so most of the film was outdoors in Rome. The emotions were brilliant. The people watching this terrible thing happen to Jesus were either mortified, or glad.When the film starts, Jesus and his disciples just concluded the Last Supper. Jesus is in The Olive Garden, having a talk with Satan and trying to resist the offers of her. But he is betrayed by Judas, who tells Caiphas, and other Jesus priests, where he is located. They arrest him on sight, and Judas gets away with thirty silver pieces. Accused of religious crimes, Caiphas brings Jesus to the Roman Govener Pontius Pilate, because Caiphas wants him excuted, but only the Pilate is able to carry out such an order. Pilate is torn about what to do, but takes his wife\'s advice to spare Jesus. Pilate lets the people decide who should be freed, Jesus or a criminal. They let the criminal be free, and Pilate allows for a fair punishment for Jesus, but he doesn\'t want them to kill him. In front of the eyes of his horrified mother, Mary, and Mary Magdalene, they flog Jesus, letting him live, but with hundreds of cuts and scars.Jesus returns to Pilate, and they call for a crucifixion. Pilate does not want this, but he allows it, and Jesus suffers and suffers untill the point where he finally is dead.Jesus was nailed onto a cross, and the film goes through the stations of the cross, as he brings the huge wooden cross to a certain point, but he falls many times, and with the aid of anothor man, his suffering is still great, but a little more easy. The film has to show all of this, but they show enough to make you feel that you were actually there. They did not show the graphic image of every whip hitting his flesh, or they don\'t show the nails hitting the bone, but they show enough of it. It was really brillant how Mel Gibson was able to direct these people who were great in dipicting Jesus and Mary, and all the other people in the Bible. The story is a very sad one, but it is also very real. It is in Latin with English subtitles, so that made me really feel like I was there, because it was the language that they spoke at that time.\\"The Passion of The Christ\\" should get many Oscar nominations next year including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Score, Best Adaptated Screenplay, and Best Director, among other awards.

Never in my life have I been so affected by a film, involved with the characters, awed, and never have I cried so much.  Let it be known that this is coming from a person who does not attend church regularly.  I loved this film not because it was based on the Bible, but because it was a well-made film that had an amazing story of love, sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness.  The whole experience is very spiritual and very personal; there is something in this film that will strike a nerve with everyone who sees it.There are concepts in this film that apply to and can be understood by all of humanity, no matter what your race or creed may be.  Such as the tender mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus, the pain a mother, Mary, feels when she sees her son suffer, or the concept of sacrificing yourself for a cause so great even you do not understand its full meaning.Aside from the emotional impact of \\"The Passion\\", this is a great film by \\"technical\\" standards.  The direction by Mel Gibson is superb and I am so impressed by his passion, drive, and determination, to get this film made.  The acting of James Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Moregenstern, and the rest of the cast does not even feel like acting, it feels real.  Caviezel, Bellucci, and Morgenstern become Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Mary.  It is easy for the viewer to forget that they are, in fact, watching a film and not witnessing the actual events themselves.  What a movie!  The score by John Debney and the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel are both stunningly beautiful and enhance the film\'s impact by enormous proportions.The anti-Semitic charges levied against this film are disturbing and upsetting.  In no way, shape, or form does \\"The Passion\\" promote anti-Semitism.  The only people to walk out of the theater with anti-Semitic feelings are people who already harbor those beliefs.As the story is set in a Jewish land, the people involved in the story are mainly Jewish, some good, some not.  As Roger Ebert said of the characters, \\"Each one representing himself, none representing his religion.\\"  The actions of Jews in the mob, government, and those in the priesthood do not condemn an entire race.  This film condemns those people themselves and THEIR ACTIONS ALONE.  In addition, Jews amongst the crowd cry out against the torture, the Jewish Simon helps Jesus carry the cross, the Jewish Veronica wipes Jesus\' face, Jews in the priesthood are against the crucifixion, and Jesus himself was a Jew.  Most importantly, the Jews did not kill Christ.  No one single person is responsible.  Jesus died by God\'s will for all of mankind\'s sins.

In fact, the only reason I went to see it was because the dialogue would be in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. I wanted to hear what Jesus\' words sounded like in Aramaic.Was I surprised! From the very start, this film was different. I\'m a Christian, so I have a bias toward the subject. However, I wasn\'t expecting the high level of artistry in its treatment, in its filming, lighting, storytelling, and imagery. It felt like a foreign film--that is, sophisticated and daring. This is NOT sword-and-sandal spectacle.From the heavy atmosphere of the Garden of Gethsemane, with its thick mist in blue moonlight, to the Mediterranean light of stone courtyards, and eerie overcast sky above Golgotha, Gibson creates an ancient Jerusalem that seems to surround the viewer. I felt a chill in the garden, almost as if I were there, wrapped in the mist. From here forward, one is pulled along, between moments of frank, intense dialogue to moments of grand mal-dreamlike violence (the arrest of Jesus in the garden) or softness (Jesus\' affectionate banter with his mother). The movie throws one off balance, shattering expectations, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was a story I knew well, but Gibson somehow made it new and surprising.There is terrible violence in this film, and there are reasons why people may object to it--especially the scene of Jesus\' scourging at the hands of Pilate\'s soldiers. Usually films leave this sort of thing to the imagination. However, I understand Gibson\'s decision to dwell so graphically on this stage of the Passion. You can dismiss suffering you don\'t see. But when it\'s pushed into your face, you have to face it. I had not realized what \\"scourging\\" meant until I saw this scene, and it gave me a painful shock of realization that I and my sin were responsible. Judging from the sound of soft sobbing from other parts of the theater, others had the same flash of realization.This film could have been mawkish, trite, tepid, politically correct. It could have ridden on the strength of popular ideology, and not bothered with edgy camerawork, editing, lighting, setting, casting, imagery.

Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well.  Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material.  This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors.  In fact, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted.  Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind.  A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point.  To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free.  Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours.  The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery.  If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it!  Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus\' feet with her tears; all that\'s said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her.  Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala\'s flashbacks took away a bit of the film\'s impact for me.  Having readThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christwhich by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson\'s last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we\'ll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it\'s origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film.  In zealously trying to reclaim \\"orthodoxy\\" and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus.  A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul\'s journeys.  There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable.  Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library.

Jesus (who is God) lived a life completely without sin, and served as the perfect sacrifice in order to cancel our debt of sin.  God created us with free will.  While we are all held responsible for our choices, God, in His Perfect love and fairness, held Himself accountable for our ability to act against His will.

Even more to show graphic detail. And, even more to release it in dead and largely dead languages. But, guts does not make a good movie by itself. Amid all the controversy, there are doubtless people with many positions and emotions, some of which are likely to be incorrect.The film starts in the garden of Gethsemane. All events prior to this point are shown in flashback. Jesus is beaten, scourged and crucified, in graphic detail. I will address different issues:Anti-Semitic: Caiaphas, overall, is not highly sympathetic. He does have a moment or two, but he is largely the one calling for the deed to be finished. The crowds cry out for Jesus\' death. But, there are priests that leave the trial of Jesus in protest. There are also sympathetic crowds as Jesus winds down the Via Dolorosa. I do not see it as anti-Semitic, and, IMO, anyone who uses this film to excuse anti-Semitic behavior is an idiot.Romans: I see that Pilate, overall, is a bit too soft to be based on the historical Pilate. He is also conflicted. Overall, the Romans are brutal. I would consider most of this material historically accurate, with some embellishment of details. The Romans are given a far worse hand than the Jews. I wish I saw more conflict in Pilate.Graphic nature: When the flail gets caught during the scourging, it is agonizing to watch. The beating is merciless. The film cuts away during much of the beating, or focus on the face of Christ. I saw it as less violent than I was prepared for, while a friend saw it as worse. It is not a child\'s movie. I am church going; he is agnostic. It is most likely my feelings about what was going on, as part of my faith, made me wish it was worse so I could truly understand.Original Languages: I am a bit conflicted on this in many levels. First, it was Latin and Aramaic from the English translations. Having taken Latin in high school, I did catch one spot where the English subtitles did not convey the full thought of the Latin. I am not good enough to find others, just the one. I would like to see this film again when I can turn off the subtitles and just watch from a pure spectator position.I am glad that the crucifixion is intercut with the Last Supper. It softens some of the pure violence displayed. You will also notice the stations of the cross, if you have ever been around Catholic doctrine. There are other flashbacks that offer a bit of relief from the story being displayed.The Cinematography is great, as is the acting. The cinematographic style reminds me of a cross between Daviau (Color Purple) and Mathieson (Gladiator). The colors are striking in some scenes and you also get the hyper-reality in others. You forget you are watching a film at times. The fact that the actors are not well known faces may help a lot here.I have two images etched in my mind. The first is Christ saying \\"Look, mother, I make all things new.\\" The second is His face when right after he states \\"It is accomplished.\\"Will you like this film? Depends on a lot of things. Christians will likely laud the film, especially Evangelicals. The rest of the world will likely find the film very disturbing and perhaps a bit too violent (as my friend did). It is a harsh film. I think it is rather haunting, whether you are a Christian or not, as it deeply illustrates man\'s inhumanity to man.The most eerie thing about the film is the complete silence, with the exception of some weeping, when the movie ends.

This movie made me cry but reading this passage in the bible can do the same. The blood was there in the real crucifixion, so why should gibson remove it and make it PG-13 or PG. This is the truth. And the blood there can maybe wake us up and let us realize that Jesus/Christ went through all of thagt pain and suffering for us. For the world. So that we can go to heaven and live in eternal bliss forever. So, the blood level was high because that\'s what really happened.

Now, I feel ready to write....MAJOR PERFORMANCES:  I think that Jim Caviezel did a pretty fine job as Jesus.  He made the torture and suffering of Christ come to life...conveying the point across as best as he could.  Of course, he had the strongest performance in the film.  However, Mary\'s (the mother) performance cannot be overlooked.  She did a good job of showing a mother\'s love for her son....and she brings the \\"human side\\" of Jesus to the fore.  Others in the film also put in outstanding performances....showing the great political and social upheaval of that period.  The Romans were depicted as people occupying a territory that they didn\'t really care about.  Gibson chose to show the old Roman glory through Pilate...and the coming decadence (and eventual downfall of the Empire) through Herod.  Whether this is historically accurate could be questioned.  The high priests of the Jewish temple were rightly depicted (in how they acted and their fear/power struggle with Jesus and the disciples)....even though I could see some lending to anti-semitic feeling through their dress and how they were shown as power-hungry political types.  There is a fine line being drawn...it is easy to cross at times....and Gibson tends to straddle it at times throughout the film where it concerns the Jews.THOUGHTS:  Yes, this movie was rather a bloody one.  Yes, some of the scenes (such as the cross being dropped so many different times) are a bit overdrawn at times.  Yes, the supernatural bits (the wolf-thing visiting Judas) were a bit confusing.  However, Gibson has intention in this.  If he made a sugar-coated movie, then no one would talk about it.  His whole intention with this film was to show how Jesus died for our sins in such a horrific way as to make people stop in their tracks and start questioning their beliefs and faith.  To me, if people walked out of the theater and asked at least one question about spirituality, faith, Christianity, Jesus, etc., then Gibson\'s goal was realized.  And, in that, wasn\'t this movie ultimately successful?  I think this movie is the closest thing to the real suffering that Christ endured, and I think it will be a long time for it is matched....if ever.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  However, I would warn people that if they are sensitive to horrific situations, or if they are mulling over questions concerning Jesus in their spiritual life....make sure to bring some tissues and be prepared for a lot of thought and introspection after the lights come back on.  If I was a parent, I would not bring my child to this movie unless they were prepared to handle it.

One thing has to be said first : this Passion is based on Saint John\'s Gospel and I have not been able to read that in any paper or magazine. At the same time the film gives many flashbacks that integrates elements from other moments into the story, for example the Last Supper which is not included in Saint John\'s Passion. The impersonification of the devil is maybe debatable though Gibson avoids any horns and other antics and uses a young character who looks like a man, though he is a woman, so we learn in the cast of the film, and this character is in a way disquieting because he looks very young, handsome and attractive among people who are definitely berserk in many ways. The great value of this film is that Gibson tries to show what this passion really was : sadistic torture and mass-frenzy manipulated by the strong desire from the High Priest, that is to say the dominating group of a theocratic state or government, to get rid of someone who represented a danger for their power. They are only motivated by political selfish reasons and they manipulate the crowd, the people even, the Romans too, into doing what they want them to do and do not have the courage or the authority to do themselves. This aspect is definitely present in  Saint John\'s Gospel and we cannot say this is antisemitic : this is a criticism of a group of autocratic rulers. The fact that they are Jewish does not change the fact. Criticizing them does not mean that all the Jews are bad and responsible for the crime. What\'s more, Gibson uses another element that is not present in any Gospel, to know the fact that some members of the Council were against the decision and the procedure, showing that we had a real debate on that issue, though not a democratic debate at all. Gibson is also very moderate on some of the torture and violence because either he does not really show the acts or he avoids some acts that are common place in such a situation. Finally Gibson is trying to show that any society tortures and even kills those they consider as dangers for them and that this happens still today, and even in our own societies, even if torturing is more psychological and economic than physical. The main idea that comes out of this film is that anyone has to fight, to the death if necessary, for what one believes to be true. In other words I will say this film, no matter how gruesome it is and how gruesome it may have been if realism had been the only objective, is a good film, and a film that should be shown to people, particularly young people, who don\'t seem to know that it is difficult and at times dangerous to defend one\'s ideas and beliefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Passion for our beliefs may lead to death", "unixReviewTime": 1081382400, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2004"}\n',

I am not Catholic or Jewish, but a Christian and member of a mainstream denomination with an undergraduate degree in history and a professional postgraduate degree.STYLE: I did not see this movie in a cinema, because I live in a small town without a decent cinema, and because I felt this subject made this film better suited to private viewing. Mel Gibson chose good actors and the film was well-filmed. However, its generally Italian cast reminded me in some ways of the Italian biblical pictures of the late 50s and 60s. I found Mel Gibson\'s use of the vernacular languages of the time very distracting, and an interferance to understanding a basic story that I was familiar with from my childhood. The language was such a problem that my wife and I changed to \\"English narration for the visually impaired\\", which was a woman reading the dialog in English and describing the scenes. It helped a lot. The major roles were excellent -- Jesus, Mary Magdalene, but I felt the language kept me from really understanding or identifying with them. Pilate, on the other hand, appeared to be channeling Brando in The Godfather. There was not a real attempt at providing any context for people unfamiliar with the story, which was a great lapse, and there were some significant problems. How much violence was there? It was so over the top, that it made Scarface look like Bambi. There was so much blood, and so much torture that it was impossible to believe that anyone could have lived through it to get to the cross. The film was somewhat dark, cramped, and confusing, so it was at first difficult to be sure who anyone was. Finally, there was an enigmatic resurrection scene totally devoid of emotional resonance and seemingly gratuitously grafted onto the first ending. Color and sound quality of the DVD were excellent.SUBSTANCE -- I understand why some people criticized parts of this movie as anti-Semitic, and I understand why some people said it was \\"too Catholic\\". The character Satan is so enigmatic I will leave him to someone else to explain his part, and there are CGI transformations of children into demons tormenting Judas. I will have to say that Mel Gibson imagined/created one of the most wondrous scenes I have ever seen, that for me summarized the whole dramatic impact of the subject. At the end of the crucifiction, after Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies, an overhead shot pans back and back, receding obviously into the sky. At the sky level, the scene undergoes a CGI transform into a drop of clear liquid, a tear from God, which when it hits the ground triggers the earthquake. As awesome as this was, the resurrection (final scene) was a brief, minimalist anti-climax that was incredibly disappointing to me, and clearly an afterthought. The burial linens suddenly deflate, and an enigmatic (and tastefully nude) Jesus walks out into the light of day.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not for the faint of heart or stomach", "unixReviewTime": 1096848000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2004"}\n',

Jesus was betrayed by Judas and handed over to his enemies, who condemn him and sentence him to die.  He is brought before Pontus Pilate, who has Jesus bound and flogged.  The flogging scenes are some of the most graphic of the movie.  Finally, Pontus Pilate agrees to turn Jesus over for Crucifixion.The Crucifixion is one of the most moving and powerful segments of the movie.  Seeing Jesus crying and asking God to forgive his captors literally brought tears to my eyes.  Jesus also promised salvation to one of the thieves, also crucified, who repented of his sins.  Jesus\' death was marked by a darkening of the world, and when one of the soldiers was told to pierce Jesus\' side to make sure he was dead, blood and water poured from the wound.  Jesus was finally taken down from the cross on Good Friday and laid to rest in the tomb, but he was resurrected three days later on Easter Sunday.This is one of the most powerful and awe-inspiring films I\'ve ever seen.  Director Mel Gibson does a remarkable job describing the last hours of Jesus\' life and the scenes, especially the flogging, cross-bearing, and Crucifixion, are some that I\'ll never forget.

I myself thought it was mostly &quot;realistic,&quot; though of course none of us were there when these things happened (the fact that Jesus lived is beyond debate) and therefore cannot judge if the events are entirely &quot;accurate.&quot; It is certainly is hard to judge this film if one includes religious bias. Technically, the film was very well done and gets bonus points for the Aramaic and Roman dialogues. The details were well-studied and reflective of Palestine under Roman rule. The classes of people were accurately represented. The setting was nearly perfect, because I\'ve been to Jerusalem and cannot tell that the film was shot hundreds of miles away in Italy (perhaps owing to the Roman influence in both places?). The script is extremely close to the words of the Bible, though some parts remained somewhat inconsistent (such as the order of Jesus\' words in certain scenarios).On the sentimental side, Gibson should not be judged for his execution, because he wanted it to be accurate. If someone finds fault with his direct approach, then I guess that person is blaming the Bible. Some people were offended that Jesus didn\'t run for his life, saying that this is entirely unrealistic and unChristian-like. However, the Bible says exactly that: that Jesus had several opportunities to free himself and not even go to Jerusalem in the first place. This is one example of Gibson\'s steadfastness to the &quot;original&quot; script, and I believe that had he altered things to make them more sensible, the movie would have suffered a lot.On the whole, a movie you\'ll want to watch just out of curiosity.

I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn\'t sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.\\"The Passion,\\" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson\'s finest work (he had previously directed \\"Bravehart\\" and \\"The Man Without a Face,\\" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that\'s how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson\'s work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as \\"The Natural\\" and \\"The Patriot.\\" To further Mel\'s perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney\'s score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can\'t think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus\' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson\'s visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it\'s not my job to do what I really don\'t want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn\'t, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus\' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that\'s all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus\' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas\' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let\'s think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that\'s anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there\'s enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that\'s all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it\'s not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn\'t a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \\"the passion\\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

SHARP", "helpful": [9, 14], "reviewText": "What the world needs now is one more opinion on Mel Gibson\'s \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", right?I am adding mine because some have asked for it. But, as has been noted hundreds of times over, the movie itself is only part of the experience that is \\"The Passion.\\" At this point the publicity, the prevailing Church attitude toward movies and celebrity, the accusations of bigotry, the accuracy and theology of the film, and the personality of Mel Gibson are of one cloth with it. So this will be a longer than usual review. It\'s taken me six months to write it.MEL - As Seattle film critic William Arnold says, \\"I\'ve been reading a lot about how Gibson has a martyr complex. I think that\'s ridiculous. Gibson is less a would-be martyr than a provocateur. There\'s something in his nature that delights in being abrasive and politically incorrect...He loves to light up a cigarette in places where it\'s forbidden.\\"I agree. Mel loves to goad people then gauge their response.Is that what \\"The Passion\\" is about? I honestly don\'t think so. Mel seems to have put an earnest effort into realizing his conception of Christ on film.MARKETING - Of far greater concern to me was the rush of devout, well-meaning Christians to this movie\'s defense and its propogation - before it was even released. Gibson\'s passionate creation of this film was an overt mainstream validation that many orthodox Christians had been starving for. His Icon production company leapt on this fact and created an enormous grass-roots marketing campaign that was wildly inexpensive considering the saturation it achieved. With volunteers fanning out across the suburbs bearing posters and leaflets and churches eagerly buying billboards that had Mel\'s name next to the name of their church, it was probably the biggest publicity coup of the decade.ANTI-SEMITIC? - In my humble Gentile opinion? Not that I can see. Apart from the Romans, virtually every character in the story is a Jew. Besides the disciples, there are good and kind Jews depicted throughout. The Sanhedrin, the religious and civic governing elders, are even conflicted over whether to put Jesus to death, with several arguing against it. Their initiation of His crucifixion to eliminate a religious threat is not a Gibsonian invention, however. It is written in all the gospels. If this film reflects poorly on anyone, it\'s the Italians. The maddeningly sadistic scourging and crucifixion are their doing. Which brings me to the next point.SHOCKING - One alarming facet of the evangelical reverence of this movie is the prima facie acceptance of the blanching gore and violence that permeate the \\"The Passion.\\" Most viewers have to shut their eyes at points throughout the film and a few have even left to be sick. Yet some parents (who would never allow their kids to hear a swear word or a discussion on married sex!) took their younger children to it because \\"they need to see what Jesus went through.\\" This simply floors me. Yes, as a Christian I believe Christ\'s death and resurrection are the preeminent events in human history and the deciding factor in every human life. But Little Timmy is still wrapping his head around Sunday school stories about the sweet, smiling cartoon Jesus who coddles lambs in his coloring books being killed because Timmy stole his friend\'s Hot Wheel car and lied about breaking Mom\'s favorite vase. Although it is true, the concept alone is often confusing and worrisome to them as it is.Am I objecting to an honest and unflinching portrayal of Christ\'s suffering on my behalf? If it evokes repentence, gratitude, and adoration, then not in the least. But if it lingers on it salaciously, then yes. I think that - by and large - this film accomplishes the positive results. But it sometimes veers into the gratuitous, too.I often compare \\"The Passion\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" That film and its chilling brutality were both an awe-stricken acknowledgement of the sacrifice of the veterans of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary. So it can be argued for \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Jesus died a vicious death to rescue all of us. We should be reminded of that and be repelled from taking its cause - our sin - lightly.But young children should not watch either movie. Period. And I hope never to watch them (along with \\"Schindler\'s List\\") more than a few times in my life. Any more than that and I might become desensitized to them and thus their central purpose. And that would be unwise.ACCURACY - It gets much of the biblically supported material right. BTW, the dream of Pilate\'s wife IS in the Bible (Matt. 27:19). The merely interpretive parts are often astonishlingly moving, even if they didn\'t necessarily happen that way.How does it fare theologically? Depends on your theology. \\"The Passion\\" makes it clear that Christ died to save the world. The most gutwrenching scene for me was when Jesus stumbles under the cross and tells Mary, \\"See, mother. I\'m making everything new.\\"Those who complain that Gibson has minimized Jesus\' message of \\"peace, love, and understanding\\" in favor of sin and death need to 1) See the movie again and 2) Read the Scriptures again. If Christ\'s was not the ultimate example of nonviolent conviction, I don\'t know what is. As the Son of God, He could have struck His executioners dead at any point along the way. But Jesus was not a first-century hippie, either. He spoke more of a literal hell and of complete obedience to God than anyone else in the New Testament. And, honestly, the last twelve hours of His life weren\'t very conducive to preaching on diversity.This is a decidedly Catholic film. For example, the Stations of the Cross (a sequence of passion events enumerated in the Catholic prayers of the same name) are dutifully enacted, even at risk of creating cinematic redundancy. Mary seems able to locate Jesus through solid rock floors by \\"sensing\\" Him. But the scenes and events based on the extrabiblical writings of mystics and on later traditions that are regarded as history by some Catholics are alternately distracting and disturbing.BUT IS IT A GOOD MOVIE? - There may be no objective way for me to watch this. I suppose the only way I can answer the question is by rephrasing: Was it a successful movie? Did it have it\'s intended effect on the audience?Yes.

You may walk out of the theatre numbed, stricken, or even uncertain of what you have just seen, but it will sink in and stick in your mind for long after you have seen the movie.The movie has chosen to focus on the moments from the Garden of Gethsemane to the events immediatately following the crucifixion, with an \\"epilogue\\" touching on the resurrection and a handful of \\"flashbacks\\" to break the intensity of the graphic details of the torture of Jesus. In Catholic terms, the movie has focused primarily on the \\"stations of the Cross.\\"If the movie has any failings, it may be that it does not explain all of the imagery that it chooses to use, which at times are either extra-Biblical (not contained within the Gospel narratives) or \\"artistic interpretations.\\" But often, such imagery can cause one to seek the deeper meanings represented by them, so it is not necessarily bad to have these. Some of these scenes are cultural (for example, Mary wipes up the blood of Jesus with a cloth, which is a culturally accurate portrayal, as the blood was buried with the body of those who died). Others are artistic interpretations (a snake proceeds from Satan, which Jesus crushes the head of, which is a signifying of the fulfillment of the prophecy of Genesis 3:15; this is not something that Jesus did literally in the Garden, but accomplished through His death). Some scenes, however, border on the bizarre (causing me to actually question why Mel saw the point of actually including them): Satan with the baby (presumably carrying the anti-Christ, although this is never truly explained), the psychotic apparitions experienced by Judas, or the crow incident with the thief on the cross (completely unscriptural and oddly out-of-place). I\'m certain they had significant meaning to Mr. Gibson, thus their inclusion, but these may be lost on the audience.While this is a movie that depicts violence, it in no way glorifies it. The amount of violence can be numbing to some, overwhelming to others. However, the depiction is accurate, including the Roman use of \\"the cat of nine tails,\\" which featured a whip with nine lashes, each typically having shards of metal or glass to rip the flesh during torture. The Romans were notoriously violent, ruthless, and on the average, they absolutely hated the Jews. To them, Jesus was another Jew and they no doubt took great delight in delivering out punishments on this magnitude. In fact, historians recording the events of the sacking of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD commented that there was \\"no room to plant a cross\\" because the Romans crucified just about every Jew they got their hands on.Some have questioned whether Pilate should have been portrayed in such a sympathetic light. Certainly, historians of that period identified him with tremendous cruelty, saying that he delighted in freely shedding the blood of the Jewish people in times of irritibility. In AD 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, after which he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide. In all likelihood, Pilate saw Jesus as simply another Jew, dispicable in his eyes. This view may have changed after the prompting of his wife, who had dreams regarding Jesus\' innocence, or it may have changed during his actual encounter with Jesus. Pilate had put down numerous rebellions before, but Jesus was completely unlike the other anti-Roman elements he had crushed previously. Unlike the power-greedy Sanhedrin, Jesus did not \\"suck up\\" to him. Nor, like the zealots and leaders of previous revolts, did Jesus curse and defy him. Perhaps, in these moments, he truly came to see Jesus as unlike those he had encountered before. We are never truly told what Pilate thought regarding Jesus, apart from the Biblical account that he did not believe the accusations regarding his guilt.Some may wonder, \\"Why is there so much focus placed on the torture and blood of Jesus in this film?\\" Central to the Christian faith is that it is by the blood of Jesus we receive forgiveness of sins. Mr. Gibson has chosen to focus on this central element. Every individual is guilty of sin that separates us from God; sin that must be atoned for by the blood of the perpetrator (the penalty of death). Rather than accept this as the ultimate fate for all of His creation, He allowed for the substitutionary willing sacrifice of Jesus, who was both fully God and fully man. That Mel Gibson chose to depict his own hands as driving the nails into Jesus was Mel\'s way of showing what His very sin had caused, but what God so willingly gave in order to forgive him.Amazingly, in spite of early charges of anti-Semetism, this film goes out its way to present the Jewish people with a dignified realism. Yes, there were the powerful who saw Jesus as a threat to their power. There were others who saw through this and refused to be a party to an illegal trial. There were others who wanted to go about their own life, but were thrust into the middle of the whole situation.Ultimately, this movie is about one message, and one message alone. It is central to the blood, the violence depicted against Jesus, and the ultimate reasons behind the crucifixion. That message is that there is only one way to restore the relationship between God and man, and that is through the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus (His blood). That is why Mel Gibson chooses to focus in on lines like, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except by Me\\" and the flashbacks to the Last Supper, where Jesus depicts the bread and wine as His body and blood, given freely for their salvation. Even the Jewish leaders give reference, in their accusations against Jesus to Pilate, that Jesus said they must \\"eat his flesh and drink his blood\\" (not that Jesus was speaking of cannibalism here, but that He was clearly teaching that His self-sacrifice was central to the salvation of humanity).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It will stick in your head.", "unixReviewTime": 1078185600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2004"}\n',

Hunter", "helpful": [7, 12], "reviewText": "Passion Re-CutThis is a review of the Recut edition of \\"The Passion.\\"  The film flows easily and the six missing minutes were not needed.  Gibson should have left the film unrated, and left out these offensive six minutes in the first place.  Notwithstanding this, I was quite impressed with Gibson\'s directorial abilities. He is quite a talent, akin to Nemoy or even Welles. I hope he nurtures this gift.As to the content, there is nothing new in this movie. The bare facts of the Christ\'s Atonement have been film and refilmed man times with many different actors.  The only new things deal with cinematography, and then the presentation of the side characters.  And the intensity of the violence.  Of course the Romans were not wimps, and scourging and crucifixion were excruciating.  Gibson saw as his goal the most accurate representation of this scourging. IMHO, we get the idea, and to emphasize the gore is emphasizing just one aspect of the Atonement, and it can distract from the ultimate victory.I found the subtitles helpful. You get the idea, but the film is infinitely better when we see Christ\'s almost nonchalant approach to his death.  He takes time to mister words to his mother (only a Catholic would pick up on this), keeps his peace with Herod, debates philosophy with Pilate (in Latin), and is absolutely above it all.  He must be a lunatic, or . . .In addition to the subtitles, the subtleties were also helpful.  You see Pilate caught between his wife\'s dream, his sense of honor, and the pragmatic desire to keep peace and keep his political position.  The encounter with Claudia and the Marys (something only a Catholic would see) is priceless.As to the alleged anti-Semitism, I just remind people about Seinfeld\'s Uncle Leo.  The reason why Seinfeld created Uncle Leo is that many people make anti-Semitic accusations at the drop of the hat, or as they are passing the hat.  This is just a way to avoid dealing with Gibson\'s message and passion.SPOILER WARNING:I am a bit critical of the special effects, specifically the snake-up-the-nose, and the growling troll under the bridge.  I understand that the Gollum-Baby was an attempt to mock the true Madonna.  However, these scenes gave the film a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" feel. It may be asserted that this is the TRUE Lord of the Rings, but to give the Atonement a surrealistic feel could leave some people with the idea that the Atonement is surreal.  Then God is surreal, and ultimately we are surreal-like the Matrix.I understand that devils are real, but they were depicted as run-of-the-mill \\"Scary Teen Movie\\" type bogeymen.  Frankly, some people cannot make the distinction.  This film was not allegory, as Narnia or Middle-Earth, but a historical film.  Keep the two separate.END OF SPOILERGibson, in addition to being a devout Catholic, is a good Kierkegaardian.  Both understand the relationship between aesthetics, ethics, and spirituality.  If you can artistically present the spiritual and ethical, then you are likely to succeed in presenting your message.  For some people, this is the only experience with the Atonement.  If people can get past this film, and find God, then this film will be successful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Review of recut, NR Edition", "unixReviewTime": 1110844800, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2005"}\n',

A faithful translation of Christ\'s arrest, torture, and execution drawn from the Gospels, Mel Gibson\'s labor of love and anguish drives home the pointed magnitude of the Lord\'s sacrifice like no other adaptation before.  For two hours the audience vicariously mourns and bleeds with the Messiah as He bears the unimaginable burden of mankind\'s sin to the grave and beyond.  The camera rarely flinches, and the only respite from the onscreen horror comes in a series of flashbacks highlighting such vital Gospel moments like the rescue of Mary Magdalene, the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper.  But this is not your typical cinematic mayhem; the violence in this movie is vital to the truth.  Gibson wanted to show people what the Lord really put himself through for us.  Yes, Jesus was the Son of God--but He was also a man, and the sufferings He endured for us were terrible indeed.  We are, truly, bought at a precious price.Stylistically, the movie never flags.  The performances are uniformly excellent (James Caviezel\'s valiant submission to his role as Christ is particularly stirring and heartfelt), the shot selection innovative (one shot in particular shows us what it might look like if God were to weep)and the tone reverent and somber, as it should be.Moreover, Gibson does not shy away from the reality of the spiritual warfare that we are all involved in whether we like it or not.  Evil lurks in the shadows, haunting, goading and tempting.  Christ refused to give in; so must we.Criticisms of this film are unfair and misplaced.  Of course it is a violent film; crucifixion is violent.  Yes, there is a lot of blood--but that blood is salvation for you and me. As for the issue of anti-Semitism, it hardly merits mention.  We are all guilty of Christ\'s blood, but yes there were Romans and Jews involved in His murder, even as there were Romans and Jews who followed and loved Him. Nothing would be served by trying to pretend otherwise.Comparisons to earlier adaptations of the life of Christ are inevitable but not necessarily appropriate.  Most of the other films cover not merely the Passion story but the whole of His birth, life,  ministry and resurrection.  This film focuses almost entirely on Christ\'s death.  For the whole story, a movie like the also excellent \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" might be more appropriate, or perhaps the recent \\"Gospel of John\\" (which also looks outstanding, but this reviewer has not seen it yet).  But \\"The Passion\\" stands alone in portraying the awful power of Christ\'s sacrifice in all its terrible enormity.If there is one thing about the movie I would have liked to have seen handled a little differently, it is the Resurrection itself.  Though present, it is primarily an epilogue.  While uplifting and comforting, after all that has gone before a little more screen time for this event might have been justified.No, this is not light fare.  This is a movie that can make you cry, groan, and grieve.  It is not a fun movie.  It will challenge you and make you think.  Adult Christians (and perhaps mature teens)should see it to be inspired and reminded of what Christ endured for them.  Non-Christians should see it to better understand what Christianity is about and who Jesus really is. But for whatever reason, *see it*.  Not for Mel Gibson, not for any reviewer, and not because of the controversey.  See it because this is a movie that can change your life.  Period.Mel Gibson said something to the effect that he believes the Holy Spirit was at work in this movie.

I even got into a discussion about it via email with someone who didn\'t think we should.

Somehow, even those statements were more vivid in my mind once I saw the movie.I came away from the movie with my faith reenergized.

Parry", "helpful": [10, 13], "reviewText": "Although my husband and I do not affiliate ourselves with any organized religion, we were very curious to see \\"The Passion,\\" even to the point of seeing it opening weekend.  Living in a place where the Bible seems to be the only book than anyone reads, we knew we needed to see the film so we could formulate an opinion, and rather than just formulating it on word-of-mouth, we chose to see the movie immediately.  Plus, \\"Braveheart\\" is one of my all-time favorite films, so I knew that a film directed by Mel Gibson would be great, regardless of subject matter.Despite the fact that my Biblical understanding is sketchy at best, I found myself engrossed in this film.  The fact that Gibson chose to have the actors speak their lines in Aramaic and Latin was, to me, a very wise choice.  Several times I have seen previews of movies set in certain countries or certain times, and not only are people speaking English, they are speaking English with American accents, which detracts from the whole point of the film.  This sounds weird to say, but after a while I forgot I was reading subtitles.  And the two languages were beautiful.It\'s been several hours since I left the theater and I still feel extremely moved by the experience of watching \\"The Passion.\\"  The fact that Jesus held onto his convictions until the bitter end, even through all of the horrible scourging and beating and crucifixion shows the extreme depth of his character.  Again, for a person who is very unfamiliar with the Bible, it was admirable to me to see that Jesus was honest about his identity and his abilities even though he knew it would send him to certain death.The cinematography of this film is beautiful, if graphic at many times.  But Gibson, who is no stranger to extreme violence in films (if anyone has seen \\"Payback\\" they know what I\'m talking about), knows the exact times to give the audience an \\"out;\\" just as I thought I was seeing too much of this, and I wanted to just look away, he would insert a flashback to earlier times in Jesus\' life, or he would focus back on Mary & Mary Magdalene and their suffering in watching Jesus\' ordeal.Some people have addressed the extreme violence in this movie, intimating that it is excessive.  Well,  considering the brutality of the Roman Empire,  I would not be entirely surprised if the actual event had been more horrendous.  We most likely were still watching a sanitized version of the event, although this was more graphic than any other previous depiction.My only complaint about \\"The Passion\\" is the fact that Gibson seems to assume that everyone watching the movie is familiar with the story; he seems to feel that no real explanation of what\'s going on is necessary.  Some may argue that to go into all this detail would involve making a four-hour film, but I do not agree.  All it would have really involved was maybe extending some of the flashback scenes: explain why Judas was in such a financial crunch that he was willing to sell Jesus\' location for a mere 30 coins.  Explain why Mary Magdalene was being stoned.  Show a little bit more of the conflict that I understand Jesus went through before his capture- this was eluded to in his prayer scene in Gethsemane with Satan, but a little more background would have been helpful.  Even if Gibson planned this purely as a vehicle to get more people to read the Bible and go to church, he should have addressed these matters just to make a more complete film.Having said that, I still feel that this movie is something every adult should  experience, regardless of religious affiliation.  Whether you believe in God or not, or whether you believe that Jesus was truly God\'s son or not,  whether you believe that Jesus died for man\'s sins or not,  the fact remains that Jesus DID exist, Jesus DID die this horrible, horrible death for his beliefs and his preachings,  and we SHOULD learn something from this, even though many of us do not.  Jesus died because people couldn\'t handle his message; he rocked  the boat a little too much for the establishment\'s comfort.  Although most of the world seems to think that they are upholding Jesus through their religious beliefs, the fact remains that people are still being persecuted (although most of the time not nearly as violently) for having different beliefs.  That is, if anything is, the true sin.As a very important note: do NOT take children to see this movie.  Regardless of your or your family\'s religious affiliation this would be an EXTREMELY traumatic film for children to see.  I know people out there are saying that there is much more violence in films right now, but this is violence on a very different  level; most of the guns and sword-fighting variety of violence in films now are very sanitized compared to \\"The Passion.\\" Nothing is left to the imagination: a cat-o-nine-tails sticks in Jesus\' flesh at one point, and violently rips off his flesh, exposing ribs, and the viewer sees all of this.  Even Mel Gibson said that this is not a kid\'s movie; and to be perfectly honest I think the MPAA should have rated the film NC-17.  Copious amounts of blood are shed from this one poor individual,  and children absolutely SHOULD NOT see this until they are AT LEAST 15 or 16!  Please, if you choose to teach your children religion, teach it through church/synagogue/temple or through reading or prayer, NOT through this film.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent, moving film-review from a non-religious reviewer", "unixReviewTime": 1077926400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2004"}\n',

We recieved it for christmas from the kids, who said it was a great movie. It is. I believe that Mr. Gibson was attempting to make a historical movie, not so much a religious one. Jesus was never a threat to the Roman Empire, and there is a question as to whether Ceasar even knew who he was. Pilate, who over the last couple centuries has been the villain in this sad tale, was actually a poor schmuck caught in an impossible political situation, with his head literally on the line if he made the wrong choice. I cannot condemn the Jewish heirarchy for their fears either, they saw more and more of their followers beginning to leave their faith and embrace this new \\"Messiah\'s\\" teachings, some of which did not comply with their accepted codes. Very scary in those days. If what Jesus said is true, then this all had to happen...one way or another..so no one could have prevented it.As to the blood and gore.....well not many people fully realized what scourging was until it was depicted in this film. Now they do. It was a horrifying and ugly punishment, and many people died from even a moderate scourging, but it was a common practice in those times. Very few people went to prison in those days, except to await sentencing, your punishment was meted out physically or you were put to death. Believe me, if you do study history, you\'ll find much worse punishments than scourging and crucifixon. Check out Asia for inovative tortures and ugly death.I thought the film did a great job developing characters, and trying to truly capture the events that happend so long ago. As to Mr. Gibson reaping the \\"gold\\", well he earned it. He spent his own money to make this film, wouldn\'t compromise on the quality of any part of it, went to great lengths to make it historically accurate and has endured a great deal of abuse for it.

It combines fine acting, good cinematography, truely disturbing though not pointless imagery, and even a couple of ancient languages (Latin and Aramaic).  It also got a lot of Christians thinking more about their Lord\'s sufferings.  On the whole these were the good parts and I recommend the film though it is suitable only for mature audiences.The film is not perfect historically and I think it may have some theological weaknesses as well.  For instance, Greek should have been employed in the film and Christ was likely nailed to a Tau cross (T) rather than a Latin cross (t).  Dr. Zugibe does a nice but short critique of the film in his book \\"The Crucifixion of Jesus: Second Edition.\\"  Theologically, I think this film may make Christians look too much at Christ\'s physical sufferings.  After all, crucifixion is often considered one of the worst forms of execution but there are others likely as bad or worse.  Even regarding crucifixion, many men, women, and children have sadly died on crosses.  What made Christ\'s sufferings unique was the spiritual atoning angle, not purely physical pain.  That said, that may be imposible to capture well in a film so I should perhaps let Gibson off the hook there.

Some people are bound to hate it for the violence of it, some will be put off by the fact that the film is totally subtitled. And some will not like it because Mr. Gibson is accused of being an Anti-Semite.  And most of those people will not have even seen the film.  Which is a shame...I\'d heard all the hype, read some of what some critics had to say and then I did what some people on line and off line who have been chatting about this film refuse to do.  I went out and saw it for myself.  According to some critics this film is anti-Semitic, according to some it is too violent, in that the depiction of Christ\'s torture is too graphic.On the former: being anti-Semitic.  I didn\'t get that feeling from the film, nor I dare say did the people who surrounded me in the theater.  The film was about a small group of priests trying to protect their power base which Jesus and his teachings threatened.  It is clearly shown in the film that during the trial anyone who stood up for Jesus including some of the other priests (who were also Jewish) where ejected from the proceedings.  And there are several scenes in which there are crowds of people weeping for Jesus(also Jewish).  There is a scene in which Veronica (also Jewish) comes to wipe the face of Jesus and is knocked way by Roman soldiers.  The film also makes a point of having Jesus say that no man takes his life but that he willingly lays it down.  I think for this film to stir feelings of anti-Semitism one would have had to walked into the film an anti-Semite.  And that to me has nothing to do with the film, and everything to do with a personal decision made long before this film was even a conception in come cases.The point is that if you\'re a Christian than the film is saying that we all are responsible for the death of Christ in that it was our sin that made it necessary for God to require a sacrifice, and for the sacrifice to be made. The film is a tool in which we are shown that Christ\'s death wasn\'t this antiseptic death, where he was hit once or twice, whipped and then nailed to the cross where he just died.  This films is showing us that he was beaten, and the whip they used had nails and bone, and glass in it, which is historically correct when it comes to devices that the Romans used in \\"chastising\\" prisoners. This kind of beating was meant to destroy the body, it was meant as a form of torture in itself. Which leads me to.....The latter: the graphic violence.  Well I really don\'t understand some people\'s objection in that there are movies out there with more gratuitous violence.  And the violence has been mindless and played for thrills, or to see just how much the director can gross the audience out, because they certainly have gotten past the point of actually trying to scare people anymore.  There are video games that advocate shooting people and stealing their cars.  Television is a wash with show after show depicting death in the most violent of ways. There are shows that show us the path of a bullet as it enters the body, shows that show us bones breaking on the impact of a blunt object.  We\'re fed a steady diet of these violent acts that seem to have no value to it other than to shock us, or to draw us in to make us watch.In this film however the violence isn\'t there to gross us out, or for shock value.  But it\'s there as a reminder of the sacrifice made by an innocent for the sins of all men.  The violence in this film is there to depict the level of love that Christ had for us in going to the cross.  It\'s about showing that we as a race and not just differing ethic groups are capable of this level of violence and so incredibly much more.  That we as a race of people can look back over our vast history and see it has been peppered with individual and societal acts of violence that make what we see in this film pale in comparison. And yet for all of our ungratefulness Christ came here and willingly went to the cross knowing well in advance what would be done to him.  Which is why in the garden at the very beginning of the film Jesus asks that if it be God\'s well to let this bitter cup pass from him.  It has to be a horrifying thing to not only know that you\'re going to die, but to know in detail the manner in which you are going to die.  And to know you are suffering and dying an innocent man. Not only that but to know that your most trusted friends are to betray you and deny ever knowing you.I\'ve done my research on the subject of crucifixion.  And it wasn\'t a sanitary from of death, it was torture.  It was done because it was one of the most painful ways to die, and people got to watch your agony.  The point was to make you suffer, and to draw that suffering out over a long period of time.  The only reason to break the legs of a convicted criminal was to make death faster, because the weight of your body would finally suffocate you.So yes the violence of the beating, and the violence of the crucifixion was indeed very graphic.  But then what the Romans did when beating criminals and crucifying people was very graphic. And shouldn\'t be sanitized because some people don\'t like it.When I saw this film there were a lot of tears not only mine but there wasn\'t a dry eye in the theater. Not one.And that alone should tell you the powerful impact the film has.If nothing else The Passion of the Christ has sparked conversation.

It is the mystery upon which the Christian religeon is founded. Christ was divine but simultaneously, human. So he was \'the way\' but he also knew what was in store for him. The references to \'the new covenant\' at the Last Supper . . . if you don\'t know about the prior covenants at Mount Sinai, or the Davidic Covenant (\\"From your loins shall spring Kings\\") of thousands of years earlier, you can\'t see the forest for the trees that Christ and the Old Testament come together as one story.So what is the mystery is that he was Divine, knew what was going to happen, and as a human, really wanted to avoid it. And, even more difficult to grasp, he was there to die for our sins. Our present sins. Our past sins. Our future sins. This is not an aberrant thought. It had been going on since the time of the the captivity in Egypt. Jesus says to the High Priest in the first interrogation in response to the question \'who are you?\' he says I AM. This is what he tells Moses thousands of years earlier. I AM.So what Gibson is doing is to show people that Christ knew he was going to suffer, and that his suffering was human and extraordinarily agonizing.It\'s hard to rate in the conventional sense.

Bernabo", "helpful": [14, 20], "reviewText": "There is a well-known Christian song that asks &quot;Were you there when they crucified my Lord?&quot;  What that meant has never been as graphically displayed in a film before as in Mel Gibson\'s &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;  The scouring of Jesus is pivotal part of this film and its emphasis is justified by the fact that Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross.  Victims of crucifixion usually lasted days, able to gain brief respite from the physical agony by pushing themselves upwards, which causes create pain in the feet, where nails have been driven through the arches.  This is why breaking the legs of the thieves would hasten their deaths: hanging by their arms their pectoral muscles would become paralyzed and eventually the lung and heart stop working well enough to continue.  Hanging by his arms, the pectoral muscles are paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act.  If Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross, then he must have been badly beaten, a point that will be seared into the mind of every viewer who watches &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;The most serious concern I have with this film is that on a couple of points Gibson decides to veer away from his commitment to providing the most accurate depiction of these events ever seen to fall back on tradition.  Although the two thieves are correctly show carrying only their cross-arms (the patibulum, which weighed about 100 pounds) through the streets of Jerusalem, Jesus once again has to carry the entire cross.  Then when Jesus is nailed to the cross the nails are place in the palm of his hands instead of through the natural opening made by the small bones of the wrists (radial and ulna).  One of the reasons the Shroud of Turin is considered an accurate depiction of a crucified Jesus is that the nail wounds are in the proper place.  Given the violence of putting the cross into position, the hands would have been ripped right through the palms of the hand.  I suspect the reason for this deviation is that Gibson was brought up with such images, codified by most depictions of the crucified Christ and the Stations of the Cross (twelve of the fourteen traditional Station are depicted: omitted are Jesus meeting the women of Jerusalem and his burial).I certainly do not consider &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; to be anti-Semitic, mainly because both of the races depicted in the film are shown as having &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; members.  Granted, only the motivation for the actions of Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) are explored; Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia) and Judas (Luca Lionello) both play out their parts without any clear reason why they are playing the parts they play.  A better case can be made that the Roman soldiers were probably not as cruel and stupid as they were shown here (they should have realized sooner to back off on the whipping or they were going to kill Jesus before they had the chance to nail him to a cross).  Yet all of these choices are certainly within the scope of the story related in the Gospels.Gibson\'s Catholicism seems to come through more in his portrayal of the Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Maia Morgenstern provides what for me were the two most emotionally compelling moments in the film.  The first is when Jesus rises to his feet after the first whipping session when mother and son exchange a look of understanding.  The second is when Mary sees her son fall on his way to Golgatha and has a flashback.  Along with another flashback of Jesus and Mary, when he was still only a carpenter, &quot;The Passion&quot; presents the most realized version of the Virgin Mary we have ever seen.The other part of the film that really stood out for me because it was equally unexpected given the film\'s focus on the Passion, was James Caviezel\'s portryal of Jesus in a series of brief flashbacks.  I liked seeing a compassionate and charismatic Jesus doing part of the Sermon on the Mount, as well as one who could laugh with his mother over his latest project as a carpenter.  The emphasis in this film is on the realism of the Passion and the crucifixion, but I can make a case that this realism extends to the brief depictions of Jesus\' life and ministry as well.Gibson takes license with the story recorded in the Gospels in several ways, with mixed results.  I like the silent flashback to one of my favorite stories of Jesus ministry (John 8:7), although once again it is tradition rather than historical or scriptural evidence that makes the adulteress to be Mary Magdalene.  The use of Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) was overdone to no great effect, but the one part that I would strongly argue went too far was the bit with the black bird during the crucifixion simply because I do not buy that God would engage in such a petty act at that time.  However I found what Judas was doing to himself between the betrayal and his suicide to be an effective addition.  I also see a bit of the medieval drama &quot;The York Crucifixion&quot; in the scene where a Roman has to get Jesus\' second arm into position to be nailed to the cross, adding another inspirational source for this script by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald.Gibson\'s masterful publicity campaign for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; resulted in more pre-ticket sales than any other film in history.  But the success the film now enjoys is because of what is on the screen and not what was in the media.  This is a provocative film, because in addition to demanding a gut reaction to the violence depicted on the screen it compels the audience to engage mentally as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "&quot;See, mother, I make all things new...&quot;", "unixReviewTime": 1078617600, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2004"}\n',

They should have done more, like they did on the mini-series about Christ and his resurrection that came on NBC 3 years ago during easter.

The only thing is that it was too violent and gory; all those beatings and wipings made me jump every time it happened in the movie. I even had to cover my sister\'s eyes because the beating scenes were so gruesome and graphic. But it shows the length that Christ went to just to save humanity and restore redemption to a fallen world, and how important He is and should be. From the scenes in the garden of Gethsemane to His trial before Pilate, His premonition that he would be betrayed by the same disciples who swore their loyalty to the crucifixion, the movie accurately reflected biblical scripture in the life that Jesus lived. Don\'t pay attention to those so-called \\"anti-semetic\\" stuff because mainstream just did that divert attention and keep people from going to see the movie.

Mel Gibson succeeded in what he was attempting to do, which was not to tell the life story of Jesus but to portray his last 12 hours on Earth. These last 12 hours are interspersed with stream-of-consciousness flashbacks (The Sermon On The Mount, The Last Supper, etc, etc) to allow many of the events to be placed in some form of context. Again, Gibson succeeds at what he\'s attempting. All of the performances are excellent. The only scene that took me out of the film was the scene with Herod; which although may be historically accurate just came off as Gibson not liking homosexuals too much (see also Braveheart). But this is a minor gripe. I also did not see the movie as anti-Semitic. I believe that if you are already prone to being anti-Semitic, the movie\'s not going to change your mind, what with the Pharisees and the angry mob demanding Jesus\' death. But not all Jews are portrayed as evil. I\'m thinking specifically of the common man who helps Jesus carry his cross to Golgotha. In short, this was a small group of people who were demanding his death, I think only a weak-minded individual could find cause to damn an entire race of people because of the actions of a few. Plus, there is the belief that Jesus was to die that day no matter what, it was his destiny to die for our sins. I came away from the film with a deeper belief of that than anything else.I also have to comment on the violence. While I never felt it was gratuitous, I did feel it was the the most realistically brutal and graphic I have ever seen in a film. I am 29 years old, have seen many many brutal violent and controversial films, they still never affected me to the point that this film did. By the crucifixion scene, my stomach was turning and my fingertips were starting to feel a little numb. I have never had a physical reaction to a film like that before. Again, Gibson succeeds. The issue I have is that this film is rated R. Not NC-17 or even Unrated. I don\'t know how this movie got released with an R, but I have my guesses (mainly influence, money, or just plain subject matter; meaning the MPAA was not going to give a Jesus movie an NC-17). In any case, releasing this movie with an R rating was wrong, and it shows how the MPAA does not have a single clue what they\'re doing. If a film is sexually explicit, it will receive an NC-17. The MPAA however does not seem to have an issue with graphic violence. I think this is just part of the reason why our American culture is morally bankrupt, since our culture dictates the rules set by the MPAA. The violence in this film would be traumatizing for a child or even young teenager, yet if a parent wants, they can accompany their child to this movie. If it was NC-17 or Unrated, anyone under 18 could not get in, period. This is not a movie for children, this is strictly a film for adults who have the ability to take the violence they\'re seeing and place it in a context of the rest of Jesus\' story. Even then, I know of adults who have seen this film who have had trouble sleeping afterwards for days.Finally, the reason I don\'t give this film 5 stars is simply from a film standpoint, it feels unfinished. Again, I know that this was Gibson\'s goal, to re-create the last 12 hours of Jesus\' life. But it feels like a 10-hour,  5 DVD long movie exists and I put in the 5th DVD in first to watch. The movie is so authentic looking, so powerful and so hypnotic, it makes me wish Gibson had, or would make a mini-series (only aired on pay cable obviously) of Jesus\' entire life.

It was that stirring and important a film for me.  But getting to the theater to see it, ironically, was a bit of a passion, in and of itself, for me.  Feeding off media accounts that described the film as brutal, violent, and horrific--Roger Ebert called it the most violent film he had ever seen--my interest in the story clashed against a visceral desire to avoid sitting through two hours of gore.  Why, I thought, should I put myself through that?  And then I started dreaming about the film, about the issue of whether I should see it or not, and it became more and more apparent that I had to do so.  After three weeks, I overcame my fear and anxiety and, with the help of friends, spent Friday night watching it in the nicest theater I could find.Mind you, I\'m not a churchgoer; my relationship with God is very personal and private.  But, even during my agnostic  youth, I\'ve always been moved by Jesus and many of his teachings.  And I\'m certainly not a Roman Catholic anymore, for reasons that my other reviews ought to make clear.  But the story of Jesus is not about denominations.When I got to the theater, there was an odd juxtaposition of all the screaming, laughing kids going to see Hollywood mainstream entertainment my own nervous anticipation.  It struck me how divorced many young people are from the story of the Passion, and, indeed, all religion.  And as I sat waiting for the film to begin, I steeled my nerves and awaited the carnage.Now maybe I\'ve watched too many news programs and Arnold Schwartzenegger films, but the Passion simply wasn\'t as brutal as the reviews  had suggested.  Sure, it is hard to watch at times, but we have become so numbed to brutality--at least I have--that I was not overwhelmed by it.  My reaction was that I was watching something that awful people do with disturbing frequency around the world.  It brought to mind the poor souls who were tortured in Iraqi jails or by intelligence agents of ostensibly modern countries, the young children raped and brutalized by pedophiles, the women raped and mutilated everywhere.  The brutality in Passion, however, was presented with such power and lyricism, that I found myself in tears through much of the movie.  I found myself filled with compassion and shame for what the human race had done to such a kind and wonderful man.  And isn\'t that what the story of the Passion is all about?This movie probably is not for people thirteen or younger.  I did not bring my own thirteen-year-old, but not because of the violence.  I told him that he had to read the Gospels first, become familiar with the story, talk to me about it.  (I can count on one hand the number of times he\'s been to church, and we have never read The New Testament together.  But the Passion has inspired me to read the Gospels with him.)Sadly, I feel compelled to answer the charges of anti-semitism that have swirled around this movie for years.  It isn\'t anti-semitic.  Not in the least.  These charges are false arguments that really go to displeasure over the nature of the Gospels, not Mel Gibson\'s movie.  Indeed, the Gospels paint in a bad light--a very, very bad light--the religious aristocracy of the time.  They are painted as materialistic, power-hungry, and sordid, no different than most church aristocracies.  That they behaved in a blood-thirsty, sanctimonious manner (demanding death for \\"blasphemy\\") was not only typical for the times, but is consistent with how many churches have behaved.  How many Roman Catholics died based upon charges of blasphemy, after all?  That these awful people were Jewish, well, that\'s just happens to be the Gospel story.  And to the claim, false of course, that the Jews in the film were depicted badly, that\'s simply selective nonsense.  All of the good characters in this movie happen to be Jewish as well, even those who do not join Christ or abandon Judaism.  Indeed, on his way to the cross, many Jewish people are weeping over the inhumanity of Jesus\' torture and death.  But why the charges of anti-semitism then?  Fear, mostly.  Fear that ignorant people will, again, use the story of the Passion as an excuse to inflict evil on Jews.  That is a reasonable fear, given history.  But it cannot justify the suppression or criticism of a core event in Christianity, in my opinion.  And the rabid outcry of the film\'s detractors has only increased the chances of madmen using the story of the Passion in evil ways.I loved this film, as you can probably tell.

Because of its religious nature, it is nearly impossible to judge it simply as some flick to go see.  However, I\'ll first judge the film on whether or not you should go out and see it in the theatres, then on its movie merits, and I\'ll conclude with some thoughts on what this movie means theologically.If you are looking for a film to escape into, or looking for great entertainment value, or basically most of the reasons we go to see movies, The Passion is not the movie for you.  Firstly, this film is horrifyingly graphic and violent.  It is an accurate reflection of life as it was.  Outside of the graphic nature of the film, the 100 minutes of cellulite that represents that sum total of Christ\'s sacrifice is agonizing.  Though Mel Gibson breaks some of this up with flashbacks from Christ\'s earlier years, it\'s just so intense that if you don\'t understand the theology of the film, you won\'t enjoy this at all.  Simply said, this film was made for Christians that are committed to their faith, not for agnostics, atheists, or the average filmgoer.I don\'t mean to imply that this film is somehow \\"too good\\" for atheists, agnostics and non-believers.  I simply mean to state that this film is not attempting to be entertaining, or thought provoking, or anything else.  Christ\'s teachings are skimmed over, and not really mentioned, the consequences of the crucifixion are not expelled upon.  Simply, this is a portrayal of The Passion of Jesus as He went through what was destined.The merits of the film as a film are not lacking by any stretch of the imagination.  Though the film is based on the Gospels, as a story the life of Christ is far from boring.  Betrayal, skepticism, murder, conspiracy, love, belief, purpose.  All are part of the story of His last day.Similarly, there aren\'t any plot problems, subplot problems, theme issues, or major holes to speak of.  The accounts of His crucifixion take less than three pages of text per gospel.  As such, simplicity prevents questions of direction and purpose.Mel Gibson directed this film quite well.  The film flows together quite well.  Mel\'s vision of the last day of Christ is well done.  I am at a lack for words when it comes to describing the thanks I have for Mel Gibson for doing this film in the way he has.  His choice to be the man who nails Christ to the cross is important, and all but avoids silly questions about the anti-Semitic nature of this film.  Gibson\'s vision of the humiliation and struggle on His last day are awakening.  As a convert from atheism to Christianity, this movie has helped me in ways innumerous.Mel Gibson aside, the acting in The Passion is extraordinary in itself.  The highlights are Hristo Shopov\'s portrayal of Pontius Pilate.  Also, kudos are needed for Rosalinda Celentano\'s thankless portrayal of Satan.  Ms. Celetano\'s performance was visually spectacular .  Finally, James Caviezel gives an unbelievable performance of endurance as Jesus.  These actors deserve a lot of credit for making this film what it is.What is this movie?  An attempt to show the earthly pain that God as Man went through for us, all of humanity.  He carried our sins, the sins of all Mankind in an ongoing sacrifice.  That burden is incomprehensible to us as humans, but we get a taste of it here in this film.

So I decided to watch it without subtitles. It is painfully obvious that this is how the film should be seen. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is not about the life of Jesus or the teachings of Jesus. It is about his death. In this case Passion meaning suffering. So when you take away the distraction of reading words on screen you focus on what you are seeing and the image becomes that much more powerful.As said before this movie is only about The Passion.

Jesus is arrested, not long after that, his mother Mary, tells his wife Mary Magdalene that her instint senses something wrong.Later they find out that Jesus has been arrested, and the Jews are now surrounding Jesus, they yell at him for claiming that he was the son of God or the Messiah.  Then Judas starts feeling very guilty and even has the devil stocking him, the next day Judas hangs himself in shame.  Also that day the Jews turn Jesus over to the Romans, and they for some stupid reason choose to relase a sadistic, ugly, cycloptic murder over the gentil handsome Jesus.Later on, Jesus is getting the crap beat out of him, then he\'s whipped so many times, then he has to carry his own cross on his back.  And the Roman solders are pretty drunk from what I could see.  Oh and it gets much more worst from here on, while Jesus is carrying his cross on his back, the Romans are whipping him even more, and he trips.  Then they order a common man to help him carry the cross.  At first he refuses, but then ends up feeling sorry for him in the end, just like a lot of other people.Then Jesus is nailed to the cross and just sits up there asking God to forgive the Jews and the Romans for killing him, and just when he thinks that God has abadoned him, he dies.SPOLIERS END HEREI would like to say that watching this movie has made me feel very confused inside.  But there are some obvious things to point out though.1.  When it came to Jesus getting tortured, of course I felt sorry for him, regardless of weither or not he was just a common man or the Son of God.  And you can see how hard it was for Mary his mother to see her son suffer, and how hard it was for her to lose him.  That could be said of anyone who has ever lost a child.  But let\'s put it to you this way, if you don\'t want to see Jesus Christ get tortured, then don\'t watch this film. When watching a typical film, I could probably only stand to see someone get torchered for a half an hour, but not two hours, espically if it\'s Jesus.  That poor guy didn\'t even shout a single insult at anyone, even when everyone chose the murder to be let go over him.2.  It didn\'t just show Jesus getting tortured, it also showed flashbacks of him helping people and asking them to forgive and love their enemies.  I\'m glad that Mel Gibson did put those flashbacks in there.3. Now for the most contraverasial point I would like to bring up.  First off I don\'t think that anyone should just go pointing fingers at the Jews, it not only sounds anti-Semetic, but you also left out an important detail, that the Romans were the ones who ordered the execution of Jesus Christ.  Think about the time that this happeend, back then if anyone claimed to be the Son of God then yes he\'s very likely to die, it was as risky as Joan of Arc claiming that she could talk to God.  Plus don\'t forget that the Romans were in charge of Israel at the time this happened, and don\'t also forget that the Romans believed in many Gods, so they probably would have put Jesus to death anyways.4. And not all the Jews were against Jesus either, most of his followers were Jewish, and I can only recall one of them that betrayed Jesus, that was Judas.  Paul may have looked like he betrayed Jesus, but in the end Jesus forgave him, because he knew that if Paul would have backed him up, then he too would have died.  And I don\'t think that Jesus wanted to put his followers in jepordy, otherwize, who would be left to preach Jesus\'s teachings?  Also Mary Jesus\'s mother was a Jew, and his so-called wife Mary Magdalene was a Jew, so were they against him?  I also saw that some of the Jews actually felt sorry for him when he was walking with his cross on his back.5. One last important detail, Jesus was a Jew, so anyone who hates Jews probably hates Jesus too.That\'s all I have to say, and with all that said and done, I have nothing else to say, except, if you want to watch a very powerful film like The Passion of the Christ then do so.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Very, Very Contraversial Religous Film Indeed!", "unixReviewTime": 1223164800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2008"}\n',

In the bible, it\'s no big secret that Jesus (a Jew) was p*****g off the Pharisees (founders of modern day Judaism) by calling them liars and hypocrites, and showing them that their silly laws were leaving them in the dark ages. Fact is, Jesus\' teachings were contrary to Judaism\'s - consequently he was a threat to the status quo. Jews have shown dissent among themselves for years over Judaism - why do you think they have Orthodox, Conservative and Reform sects, some with female(!) Rabbis? A female trying to be a Rabbi back then would have been dragged from the temple and stoned to death.3. Too far ahead of his time with his crazy ideas (shown in his actions more than in his words) about womens\' rights, the rights of children, and God\'s law over mans\', he was just too much of a threat. Due to the fear of the people in power at that time, they had him snuffed out. No big surprise, all of it is in the bible - why is then a portrayal (an accurate one at that) of Jesus\' execution and the events leading up to it considered so controversial? It\'s been in the bible for centuries.4. It\'s not a feel good film. I felt drained after watching this exceptionally long torture session. I wonder if in fact Jesus went through everything TO THE EXTENT the movie depicts. Most of us would have been dead before the cross was handed to us. However, I have no doubt of the accuracy of the torture and beating scenes. The Jews living on Masada committed suicide rather than be captured by the Romans. This movie might give one an idea why.5. I am glad I saw it. Most religious films show an overly sweet Jesus with shlock like glowing robes, which leaves us with the impression that Jesus was somehow other worldly. He was, but he was also human. In most of these movies, we have no idea how brutal an execution like a crucifixion was. Now we know. There are also no glow in the dark eyes, kitschy halos or Romans talking in Shakesperian accents in Passion, thank you Mel.6. I felt neither angry nor anti-Semetic (I was raised a Catholic but dropped out at age 9) after watching this. It depicts human folly and the killing of an innocent man during some rather turbulent times. I am also technically (according to Jewish law) Jewish on my mom\'s side, and I didn\'t feel at all paranoid. To my Jewish friends who do feel that way, remember, this is not the 1100\'s or the 1930\'s. People are brighter than that now, give it a rest, ok?7.

The movie is nearly entirely in Aramaic (perhaps the original language of Christ) and Latin (for the Roman guards) with some subtitles.  The resurrection is not covered in the movie; however, we do see glimpses of the coming invents in a renewed (bodily) Christ and Satan being bound in Hades.  Mel Gibson is a traditionalist Roman Catholic who has attempted to restore a once well established tradition within the modern age, that of the Passion Play.  During the Middle Ages, the Passion was routinely acted out in churches across Europe, revealing the inner secrets of Christ through this profound drama.  Gibson bases his Passion on the Four Canonical Gospels (especially that of Matthew) and also on some of the visions of the Roman Catholic nun Venerable Catherine Anne Emmerich (who experienced visions which she recorded during a long illness, and supposedly lived for several years sustained upon the Holy Eucharist alone).  The scenes from the movie are indeed surreal and they reveal the inner torments and struggles between God, the Father and Satan within the minds of Jesus Christ, Son of God and his betrayer Judas Iscariot (who tormented by demons will eventually be driven to hang himself).  The movie features much from both the Bible and tradition and legend, including many references that are likely to be missed by those not familiar with both (for example, the serpent snapping at the heel of Christ who stamps upon its head, cf. Genesis).  The movie also has the air of mystery and like the early Greek mystery cults the Passion and the subsequent Stations of the Cross serve as a mystery of the living Faith of Christ revealed in his death and resurrection.  The Pharisees and high priests of the time are portrayed as truly wicked and serve a purpose only to mock and jeer at what they do not (indeed cannot) understand.  Many have accused Mel Gibson of antisemitism, merely because he would not bend to the political correct ideals of the day and remove the troublesome passages from the Gospel accounts.  Indeed, the world of First Century Palestine was very different from the world of today, but it is clear from both reading the Gospels and from seeing the movie based upon them who the real culprits are for the death of the Messiah.  I think Mr. Gibson does a particular service to the modern era by revealing these truths which were once known to many (during the Middle ages) but which since have become buried and made esoteric courtesy of post-Enlightenment modernism.  The movie is extremely gory, depicting sufferings on a level that may be incomprehensible to many.  In fact, at many points during the movie (particularly during the more touching moments in which Jesus and his mother Mary were seen together or the moments with Mary Magdelene as well) I felt myself tearing up (often somewhat uncontrollable).  The scourgings for example were particularly difficult to watch, and the actual act of nailing Christ to the Cross was very gruesome.  You may have to turn your head away, but if you can you should probably watch what you can make it through so as to make it fully beyond this step of initiation into the Passion Play.  The movie ends with Christ dead upon the Cross and being buried.  At the moment of Christ\'s death, the sky is said to have darkened up and the Earth to have quaked and fissures opened up, also the dead and many saints were said to have risen from their graves.  Some of this is depicted near the end of the movie.  The movie does not show the Ressurection (which is unfortunate) leaving us off with a somewhat depressing picture of things, until the Easter season comes and reveals for us the fullness of Christ resurrected bodily and the redemption of mankind.  The movie shows some interesting developments of the mass, including the work of Jesus Christ as a carpenter; however, it does not show an actual Roman mass - yet, it does preserve the exact words of Christ used to consecrate bread and wine during the transubstantiation.  I do wish that Mr. Gibson had shown more of the details from the Bible account, more flashbacks for example, and more from the tradition and subsequent legend, and less gore, perhaps.  However, I recognize that this would have been difficult to do given his constraints.  Upon the bodily death of Christ upon the Cross, the spear of the Roman centurion Longinus is used to spear the side of Christ releasing water and blood from his body.  A true miracle of God.  Also, the movie depicts the salvation of the good thief at the Cross and the raven picking at the eye of the other thief.  This movie represents a true return to the tradition of the Church and to the medieval Passion Play for modern day America.  Perhaps more who watch this movie will be inspired by it, and see in it the Christianity of their youth which they have since either rejected or fallen away from.  A true restoration of Christianity within America could indeed be a most glorious thing - and with the coming of the Easter season we shall once again witness renewed life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Passion of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.", "unixReviewTime": 1079395200, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2004"}\n',

Ever since I saw \\"Pay it Forward\\", I saw something of Christ in Caviezel and hoped he would actually get to play that role someday.  The other stroke of genius with \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" was using dialogue in the Aramaic and Latin languages, to lend a huge dose of realism to this film.  Finally, we get to hear the words of Christ and his disciples in the language they spoke!This film has great, Oscar-worthy performances by Caviezel, by the woman who played his mother, and by the actor who played Pontius Pilate, and I hope they receive that recognition come Oscar time.  The visuals in the film were excellent and the film moved along, growing in intensity with each scene.  Gibson is a masterful storyteller and visual artist, and I also hope he receives a nod for Best Director by the Academy.The downside of the film for me is the violence.  I do understand Gibson\'s intention was to show us the amount of suffering Christ endured for the sin of humanity and that it is our duty to endure the pain of watching such brutal violence he endured, but I thought it went on too long, with too much intensity.  The violence surpasses \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and was almost too much for me to handle.  I was pleased that Gibson offered brief respites of the violence with flashbacks from key scenes in Jesus\' life...the most tear inducing for me being the little boy who fell and was comforted by his mother.  My favorite scene in the whole movie was seeing Jesus laughing as he talked to his mother about a table he was making.  I wished there were more of that...in fact, I would almost beg Gibson to make this film the middle in a trilogy...with the same actors, one covering \\"The Life of the Christ\\" and the other covering \\"The Resurrection of the Christ\\".  In fact, the film is so brief in the resurrection scene, that I felt awful leaving the theater.  There was no uplifting final scene to carry with you when you left the theater.  I guess the point was to make us feel awful and guilty and hopefully get movie goers to head straight to church to confess their sins and renew their commitment to Jesus once again.Which brings me to my final point.  This film has been seen as the best evangelical missionary tool to come along in ages.  Many people seem to think that you could show a film like this to a non-Christian and they would be so guilt-ridden that they\'d instantly convert to Christianity.  If only if it were that simple.  For me personally, a Christian all my life who leans towards Buddhism, I find the story of making Jesus out to be a sacrifice to appease an angry God to be simple, illogical, and insulting to anyone who believes in an all-knowing God.  Portraying Jesus as a mere sacrifice who endured suffering for the sake of humanity does have metaphorical implications, but such violence is more likely to turn off people who shun violence, like many Buddhists are.  But that\'s my only major complaint about the film.  It doesn\'t detract overall from the high quality standards of this film nor its importance.  It is worth owning on DVD and definitely will be my annual Good Friday tradition, so I can remind myself on that sorrowful day just what Jesus had to endure on his way towards divinity.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A passion for violence that\'s almost too intense", "unixReviewTime": 1097798400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2004"}\n',

Not the scriptures, not an epiphany; a movie. And to that end, remember to view it as a movie; try not to let your emotions or faith overrule your logic, if that make sense.I gave this four stars for its relative adherence to the Bible; sure, there were some discrepancies; there always are in films of this nature. But basically, it stuck to the story. The cinematography was excellent. Some of the symbolism (Satan, the raindrop/tear) was kind of heavy-handed, and the acting, for what it was, ranged from competent to very good. While I give Jim Caviezel his props -- it wasn\'t an easy role by any means -- I also think that a number of other actors could have handled the role just as well, if not perhaps a bit better. But that\'s just all opinion.And that\'s what Passion comes down to for all of us. Whether or not it supports your faith, gives you religion, etc., is, again, a personal thing. But as a film (and it is a film, remember) my feeling is that even though we know Jesus suffered horribly, the blow-by-blow Gibson offered was kind of over the top; that much graphic in-your-face violence I think, proved almost counter-productive to the point he was trying to emphasize; there\'s a thin line there that\'s easy to cross, and he stepped over it more than once. The idea of unrelenting pain can be conveyed far more deeply, I think, by image and suggestion rather than image alone. True, the violence in Passion was far \\"purer\\" that that in, say, Kill Bill or Lethal Weapon, in terms of its representation, but raw violence is still raw violence. And one needs to know its limits. I\'m not a squeamish person by any means; I\'ve seen lots of gorefest flicks. But when I saw Passion, there was a point when I wanted to jump up and say \\"Enough!! We get the point, OK??\\"And for all those who say \\"That\'s what it was like!\\" \\"He\'s showing it as it happened!\\" \\"The film is historically accurate\\" They\'re all incredibly pretentious statements. The fact is, neither you or anyone else -- INCLUDING all the experts who attest that the film was accurate-- knows exactly what it was like unless they were there. You have to accept that; it\'snot a matter of faith but fact. NOBODY knows for sure.Anti-Semetic? Please. First off, not all Jews came off badly; only those under Caiphas\' influence. It\'s like saying all Americans are racists because some of them belong to the Klan.Second, if anyone came off as really nasty here, it was the Romans. They were -- those soldiers in Judea, that is -- portrayed as completely sadistic almost throughout.Bottom line: watch Passion for whatever reason you wish.

Next to \\"Irreversible\\" this film is probably the only real shocker to come out in years. If the subject matter had been anything other than the trial and execution of Jesus Christ it would hard to image this getting a release in most countries. In fact Sunday school is about to take a very brutal twist that even the most seasoned of \\"gore-hounds\\" will have trouble stomaching.Here, in The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson gives us 127 minutes of non-stop graphic and violent torture sequences. Once the screaming starts it DOES NOT STOP! It has been a long time since cinema has driven home such powerful and disturbing imagery. In one sequence a huge visible chunk of Jesus\' chest is torn away by a clawed cat-o-nine tails to reveal his ribs underneath. By the end of the movie Jesus is virtually half a skeleton with most of his body tissue removed and bone chipped away. It is the first time many of us have seen these images outside of a \\"Slayer\\" album cover and Gibson has turned the tables on what we could conventionally conceive in our minds as the murder of Christ. Nowhere in cinema has this subject be treated with the absolutely truthfulness and respect that it deserved. The actual term for these proceedings (the last twelve hours of Christ) is called - \\"Deicide\\" (The act of killing a being of a divine nature; particularly, the putting to death of Jesus Christ). The Passion of the Christ in wholly and indisputably a hell of a cinematic challenge for a rendition of \\"Decide\\" as it has never been seen before. You will not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. When you come out of the cinema it is probably best if you take a lie down somewhere and contemplate what you have just witnessed. You have NEVER seen anything like this before... nor will you want to again.The Passion of the Christ does not go into much detail about the life of Jesus or anything much biblical. In fact it is more akin to watching \\"No Comment\\" on Euro News (basically news reports with just video images) and letting you make up your own mind. For those of you who are not informed about what the life of Jesus was before he was crucified then you would do well to watch some early Hollywood production of the man\'s life (even though The Passion of the Christ is NOTHING like anything Hollywood has put out before). Jesus does say the odd line now and again but mostly this is a story about physical and mental suffering and there is no shortage of that as the film descends into depths that cinema has not treaded on before and where angles would fear to go. The film starts in the Garden of Olives following the Last Supper and Jesus\' encounter with Satan (the only flaw in the film was Gibson\'s overuse of these pantomime type evil characters and their satanic servants, rendered needlessly in CGI and do not really fit this picture that much in the same way that Jar Jar Binks did fit well with Star Wars Episode1.). Judas Iscariot cuts a deal with the Pharisees, who then pick Jesus up, torture him and humiliate him, before sending Jesus to a Roman trial to face charges of blasphemy. There are many moments of absolute unflinching horror throughout the ordeal even before the first whip is unleashed, however these are cleanly swept aside by the little miracles that occur along the way but it would only spoil it for you to tell you what these are (a scene involving the cross being turned over is one of the most startling shots ever committed to celluloid and is sure to raise a few hairs). These little miracle moments are extremely powerful and are captured wonderfully by the glorious cinematography (The Passion of the Christ looks simply divine).All in all it is hard to call this film a movie or an art-film. It is more akin to an `out of control\' dramatic crime scene recreation that we see on true life law enforcement television programs, but here it is all uncut and does not shy away from exposing us to unrestrained, raw and unlimited amounts of human hatred and aggression. Forget the whole \\"Anti-Semitic\\" lark that the media went on about. The film clearly explains that Jesus, the son of God, was God, and chose his own fate. The fact that Jews or Roman\'s where involved is only incidental to them being there. They are the same as anyone else who could not see with open eyes! In fact under all the blood, bruises, bone and bumps Gibson manages to leave Christ\'s right eye intact. He highlights this eye at times with a subtle illumination that carries an `all seeing\' message with it and is another strong imagery device that is used in this production. It is the little things like this that make the film ingenious in a `clever\' Spielberg sort of way. However when all is said and done Martin Scorsese\' The Last Temptation of Christ can still hold its own against this offering, however this one is certainly eons more disturbing.This is not a film you will enjoy but you will be damn glad that you went to see it and certainly since the original Matrix there has not been a good soul shaker doing the rounds in a long time.

Every frame is a work of art...I was moved to tears, much more than once. During the crucifixion, I turn to my sides & I see the people beside me crying as much as I was. When the lights dimmed back, after the movie ended, there was COMPLETE silence: not even a cough. The audience, & myself, were struck so deep by the movie. We all just sat there for a while, starring at the screen...amazed by everything...still soaking it all in. It was unbelievable.As for the Satan parts, I thought they were just another thing Mel Gibson added to separate his Jesus movie from the others. I say this in a GOOD way. No other Jesus movie showed the hands get nailed into the cross. No other Jesus movie showed the beatings & the blood that was spilt for everyone. No other Jesus movie showed Satan drive Judas to his death, tempt Jesus, or to basically tell the Roman\'s to beat Jesus until there was almost no flesh remaining. It\'s just one more thing to make it a differnt style of painting, of the exact same picture.As for the \\"blaming the Jews for Jesus death\\" part...there is no blame! This movie was not made to play a \\"blame game\\". If you are going to see the movie to try to find anti-Semitic parts in the film: don\'t waste your time & money! I\'d rather have a person sit beside me in the theater who is there to be moved by the death of Jesus Christ than to try to find things wrong with a Mel Gibson movie.The violence in the movie was there for a reason. How can you show a movie about Jesus being beaten & crucified without showing the true gore of it all? All the past Jesus movies showed 5% of the gore shown in \\"The Passion\\" & no other Jesus movie has moved audiences, & myself, as much as this movie has! Jesus was not just beaten for a while & put up on a cross...he was beaten brutally with sharp weapons, his hands were nailed to a cross, & he died a long, painful death. No other movie than this has bothered to go into such detail. The violence is truly what stays with you; it is burned into your mind after you\'ve seen it. You no longer think lightly of the death of Christ.At the beginning of the movie I saw Jim Caviezel, I remembered a man I\'ve seen from \\"Frequency\\" & \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\". By the end of the film...I saw Jesus, I felt as though I saw Jesus die before my eyes. The acting is so Oscar-worthy in every way! This movie is not made to offend anyone, or to blame anyone for the death of Christ. It is to depict the awful, gruesome death of Christ & the message he gave the world before he left: love one another. BOTTOM LINE: anyone who can take the violence of the film should see it. It\'s a great, unforgettable movie that deserves every Oscar there is. Anyone who can\'t take the violence, or is simply trying to find anti-Semitic parts, shouldn\'t see it!

I read all the negative reviews (before I went) and thought I was in for some kind of documentary on crucifixion, or a gory movie filled with violence; but instead it was a riveting story, and the violence fit the movie theme perfectly (I think most reviews just don\'t get it, cause they don\'t believe in sin) this movie is about GOD\'s LOVE for us sinners; the violence Christ suffered serves the purpose of forgiving all our sins. Also I heard all the arguments about the movie being anti Semitic, but how could it be, Jesus, the Apostles (especially John who is featured throughout the movie), Marry Jesus\' mother and Mary were all Jewish. The movies shows that only some priests wanted Jesus crucified and that they stirred up a mob to pressure pilot to put Christ to death, as the scriptures say. It in no way casts blame on all Jewish people and in fact if everyone would just read ISAIHA chapter 53 in the Jewish scriptures that would see that the Christ came to die for us. Also I heard an argument that it shows Jews as ugly and hooked nosed and this is pure BS, the ugliest person in the movie was the actor who played the apostle Peter.  Really the Roman\'s look the worst in this movie; All the priest looked normal to me. The movie (all 2:06) went by fast. While I would not call this movie entertaining (it was in a way), because of the subject matter, it was emotionally gripping, and visually engrossing and I was completely transfixed by the movie. My mind did not wonder off (like usual at a movie), Not once. It garbed my attention from the first moment in the garden and kept it till the resurrection.

Just picture it as reading a book, but with moving pictures. Just dazzling! You can really feel the pain for Jesus while he is being tortured. The whole torture scene was one of the most gruesome things in movie history that I\'ve ever seen. I really do think that the violence is just there to show how brutal people were back then. During some violent scenes, such as the pounding of the nails and Jesus bearing the cross, they would switch to a flash back for an instant such as the last supper to ease some of the stress for the viewer so they don\'t take in the whole thing at once. One of my favorite parts was when Jesus is resurrected at the end, and as he gets up and walks by, you see the holes in his hands left by the nails. This movie really gave me a whole new perspective on life and how I take alot of things for grantit.

The violence is tough to watch but it is not gratuitous.  Jesus according to the Gospels did endure horrific brutality and Roman crucifixion was designed by the state to be a savage deterrent.  Two scenes that stick with me are the playful loving tenderness between Jesus and Mary when Mary calls Jesus inside for mealtime while he is busy building a table, and the other is Simon of Cyrene screaming at the people and soldiers to stop beating Jesus as he was lying on the ground, then whispering to Jesus that they are almost there as he helped him carry his cross to Golgotha.  That was a very powerful and moving scene, among many throughout the film.  Whatever anyone thinks of Mel Gibson as a person, he used his talent and considerable skill to create what has turned out to be one of the most important films ever made in cinema history.

They answer Barabbas,and much to his delight Barabbas is set free amongst the crowd.That leaves Jesus,and what to do with him? Pilate is forced into a corner and has no choice but to condemn Jesus to death,by crucifixion.Jesus is forced to carry his own crucifix and it is a brutal and terrifyingly wretched long walk to a mount outside the city.He is hounded every step by his Roman guards,who before the march started,gave Jesus his crown of thorns.We watch as Jesus is tied and nailed to the cross and it is raised up into place.On lookers,including Mary Magdalene,his mother Mary and his brother,watch as Jesus slowly but surely slips into unconsciousness and death.The sky darkens,a wind storm and earth tremors follow.The film ends as Jesus is resurrected and the stone blocking the cave rolls away from the entrance.I found it to be an emotionally draining experience.Gibson portrays each punch,each spit,each nail driven into flesh,each metal tipped whip and on and on,with startling realism.He wanted you to see and imagine just how much Jesus suffered for all of us and exactly what he died for.There is no movie before or since that has portrayed Jesus\'s final hours in such a graphic manner,and I doubt if there ever will be.Gibson set such a high bar here that it is,for all intents and purposes,out of everyone\'s reach.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.This version is the newer two disc set which has the recut version on it.Extras abound and are too numerous to fully mention,but include everything from commentary to a myriad of featurettes.This is everything you wanted to know about the Passion and then some.You can debate the religious implications and even the reality of what you see here all you want,but there is no denying its impact.Gibson funded this epic himself and in the process created a one of kind film,in ANY genre.Highly recommended.4 1/2 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A graphic portrayal of Christ\'s last few hours on earth.", "unixReviewTime": 1364515200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013"}\n',

The review claimed that by making Annas and Caiaphas, the Jewish high priests, look so evil that we do not see ourselves as crucifying Christ, but cast the blame for Jesus death on those evil Jewish priest, hence by implication, the Jewish people as a whole.Annas and Caiaphas were filthy rich, belonging to the sect of the Sadducees that rejected the work of the supernatural and were in collusion with Rome. These men were just about as corrupt and evil as anyone could be.  Try as one might, few of us have anything in common with these them.  Annas and Caiaphas were evil, corrupt men.  That is not to say they were devoid of any good, but it is obvious from the gospel accounts that these men sought the preservation of their own wealth and position above that of seeking justice.  On the other hand, we see members of the Jewish Senate who saw this execution as a travesty of justice,  we see the Jewish father who helped Jesus carry his cross, and the Jewish women who wailed for Jesus death.  We see the Romans who beat Jesus, humiliated  him and nailed him to the cross. Life is rarely as simply as good guy- bad guy- bad people are capable of doing good things, and good people are capable of doing evil things.Gibson hit the nail right on the head.  Aside from being a fairly accurate account of the gospel story, Gibson did show that everyman was responsible for Christ\'s death.  From the Roman governor to the Roman soldier, from the Jewish leaders, to the Jewish rabble, from rich person to poor person, from Jew to Gentile- all bear responsibility.  Anti-Semitic?  No way.

The filming is graphic and detailed and the decision to have people speak in their original languages was very intelligent.  The film has been accused of being antisemitic--partly because of Gibson\'s escapades-but I don\'t see it.  It is no more antisemitic than the Gospels, themselves.  Yes, I think it can be argued that the Gospels show an anti-Pharasee bias--make that an anti-establishment bias--but they can\'t be antisemitic.  The early Christians, precisely the ones who wrote the New Testament, were all Jews.  It is hardly credible that they were antisemites.  They were, however, members of a new wave of Judaism, a wave that witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the razing of Herod\'s Temple.  They didn\'t like the Temple Establishment and their writings show it, sometimes even glossing over the Roman responsibility for Jesus\' crucifixion.The film is both detailed and excruciating.  It emphasizes Jesus\' suffering for mankind.  It\'s difficult to \'overdo\' something as hideous as death by crucifixion but I think the directors come close.  The scourging is overdone to the point of unbelievability.  It goes on far too long and is laid on with too much force.  The scourging of the type depicted may have killed a man without the necessity of a cross.  Of a near absolute certainty, a man so scourged would never be able to pull--even with help--the cross up to the hill of Golgotha.Other than that I have only one other technical comment and that involves the cross, itself.  The cross has become the living symbol of many Christian faiths but many people believe that there was never a cross.  There is evidence that, in some places, the uprights were always kept in place on the execution ground.  The condemned man carried the crosspiece on his shoulder to the place of execution.In A.D. 70, Jerusalem fell to a Roman army and thousands were crucified around its walls.  It seems highly unlikely that full crosses were used in the executions.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "the scourging alone would have killed him", "unixReviewTime": 1219276800, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2008"}\n',

In the theater I was in, the couple to my left walked out at about 55 minutes into the film; but the couple to my right (with children in tow) cried during the last hour, but stayed nonetheless.  This experience instructs my review.For non-Christians (of which I am one), this film could easily come across as nothing more than an exercise in ultra-violence.  (In fact, I heard one reviewer on NPR compare it to \'Clockwork Orange.\')  For Christians, however, it is more, especially for those Catholics who grew up walking the stations of the cross at lent (of which I was one).  That is, the film is an affirmative, dramatized contemplation of Jesus\' crucifiction.The most prevelant criticism (most scathingly delivered by the New York Times) is that this film\'s focus on this violent end of Jesus\' life demeans his teachings of love and peace, and as such, renders the film utterly inaccessible.  I agree - but only with regard to non-Christians.  To be sure, Jesus\' teachings are important, but many of those same concepts are contained in the canons of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even secular humanism.  Indeed, there is only ONE fundamental aspect that distinguishes Christianity from these other religions and philosophies - the belief that Jesus, as part-God and part-man, chose to suffer immensely to save all of us from original sin.  As un-politically correct as Christianity is in this day and age, I applaud Mel Gibson for this unapologetic expression of the end of the life of his Christ.  Nonetheless, the film will likely appeal only to Christians.What is most regrettable about this film is the other critism taht the film places the blame for Jesus\' death primarily on the Jews.  First of all, considering that the gospel of Matthew contains a clause where the Jew place the blood of Jesus\' on their OWN hands (which has been removed from the subtitles of this film), I found that the film is not more anti-Semetic than the source material.  What this film does portray is a FEW (not ALL) Jewish elders taking it upon themselves to make sure Jesus, a threat to their political/spiritual influence, dies quickly and without much consideration.  As for claims that Mel Gibson put an anti-Semetic spin on the story, in the scene where the Pharisees gathered, for every moment with angry Jew seeking the blood of Jesus, there is equal time devoted to the efforts of a sadistic Roman, the dissention of a Jewish elder for not convening the full counsil before deciding upon Jesus\' fat, or a poignant moment with a compassionate (Jewish) Veronica or Simon.If you are a Jew or a Muslim, you SHOULD take issue with the accuracy of the scriptures and the very notion that Jesus was THE Messiah, and I believe THAT would be a worthwile debate.  But THIS is a film by a Christian, for a Christian audience.  Attacking a FILM as an \\"irresponsible\\" action in light of a minority of anti-Semetic individuals (who will find a reason to hate Jews without a film) and comparing a FILM to institutional atrocities committed by Christians over the last several centuries is intellectually dishonest, if not perversely thin-skinned.  For the vast majority of Christians, blame is not a fundamental tenant of Christianity.  What Christians ARE taught, which is emphasized in this film is that Jesus made a free choice to accept a foreseen fate.  (For example, note the scene where Pilate asks Jesus if he has any defense for himself.)  Put another way, it is irrelevant to the vast majority of Christians whether and to what extent the Romans or the Jewish elders were responsible.  To Christians, the choice was with Jesus, he made the choice, and he paid the price for that choice - that is ALL this film is about.  Nothing more, nothing less.To the Jewish groups who demanded that Mel Gibson make 26 pages of script changes (that were not made), I say, \\"It\'s not all about you!\\"  I applaud Mel Gibson for making this FILM with such an inspired and unrelenting purpose - that is what art is all about.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Required for Christians - others are not likely to", "unixReviewTime": 1078099200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2004"}\n',

It\'s been going on for centuries surrounding how Christ died and who killed him. This film does not reflect that at all and doesn\'t put any one group in jeopardy. It was our sins that nailed Jesus to the cross. His love kept him there. Remember when Jesus said he had the power to lay down his life and take it up again. This command came from His Father in Heaven. This is also written in the Scriptures of the four Gospels.&#60;P&#62;The film itself is beautifully portrayed and well-acted. The artistry is superb in authentic art and culture of biblical times. Jim Caveziel who plays the part of Jesus Christ so well that you think it\'s Jesus himself who took over the part. He looks like him and acts like him! His role is sincere and powerful. Maia Morgansten who plays his mother, Mary is beautiful in her role as she follows her son Jesus from the trial, scourging and the cross. The graphic violence maybe too intense for small children. So adults should review before letting young children view it. One may question why Gibson\'s film was so violent? He did a good job in sticking with the Scriptures according to the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 52 & 53. The crucifixion an ancient form of execution invented by the Romans was not a pleasant sight. According to history when crucifixion was in use unfortunate candidates were tortured or flogged before being hung and some didn\'t survive the horrible beatings.&#60;P&#62;The Passion is a film of painful beauty and sacrifical love of mankind. It is spoken in Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) and Latin with English subtitles. But one can understand the language by heart just by watching the suffering of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It\'s one of the best Christian film on the subject of how Christ really suffered and died for all of us. It has a nice end that doesn\'t leave the viewer thinking that Christ just died and shows He victoriously rose from the grave on the third day.

The Passion portrays Christ\'s death as one of the most brutal I have ever seen in any movie, and I\'ve watched a lot of modern day TV & film with some ugly death scenes...including HBO\'s Rome that suggests it was a pretty barbaric time in the hundred or so years Before and After Christ.Perhaps the interpretation that Christ\'s death was so horrifying was \\"controversial\\" to some because they\'d have preferred a depiction of a \\"kinder, gentler\\" murder of Jesus. I\'d therefore have to go with \\"deeply upsetting\\" versus \\"controversial\\" when asked about the violence in this movie.The other word-of-mouth controversy that I heard about regarding this movie was that the Jewish community was angry because The Passion depicted Jews as cruel and savage. On the contrary...Jews were depicted no more uncivilized than others living in the period. If fact, according to The Passion it apparently wasn\'t even the Jews that directly murdered Jesus; Jewish priests did have him arrested. But ultimately--according to the canonical Christian Gospel that the The Passion clearly based a lot of its story from--it was Pontius Pilate (the governor of Roman Judea) that presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion. Hence, it was the Romans that carried out a death sentence and did most of the actual torturing and crucifying.Therefore, as for controversial....I say, what\'s all the hub-bub, Bub?As for the movie...it was extremely powerful. Informational...educational even. The film\'s dialogue is in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, with subtitles. And do indeed watch it with the subtitles; watching in the native languages adds a whole degree of reality to a movie that already comes off as very believable.The acting is first class. James Caviezel\'s portrayal of Jesus is burned onto my memory. There are many aspects to this movie that I will not soon forget.

No matter how good your intentions are, some group is gonna get angry be it Jews, Catholics, Methodists, Moonies or Voodoo Witchdoctors.  Mel Gibson knew this before he wrote one word of the script, yet he pressed on coz he really wanted to make this film.  Most of the reviewers here are using this review forum for some kind of religious debate rather than reviewing this film for what it is: A Film.  You can whine about how accurate you think this film is, but bear in mind that this is not a documentary, it\'s a dramatization.  Remember watching Rescue 911 or Forensic Files and they would show you the dramatized re-enactment of the crime?  That\'s kinda how you have to view this.  It may not be a play for play of the way you believe the crucifixion went down, but it\'s probably pretty damn close.  Remember, this is a film based upon a book.  Any translation of a book to a movie gets a little jumbled-just ask Stephen King-and I don\'t see why the bible should be an exception to that rule.  Most people interpret the bible differently, so there\'s another reason why this film doesn\'t seem quite right to you.  Ya know, the bible is not a novel and isn\'t the best book when it comes to description and detail, so it\'s only logical to fill in those holes with what you feel seems most appropriate, and I\'m sure this is what Mel did.  You\'d do it to, and probably alot differently than most other people.  People have been whining about the violence as well.  Well, this film is about the crucifixion of Jesus, is it not?  Candy coating this event is okay to a two year old child(I went to a Lutheran preschool that had lots of pictures of a smiling cartoon Jesus caricature hanging on a cross), but we\'re adults here and we all know that getting beaten to a pulp and crucified isn\'t PG-13 material, especially when you think of the way the ancient Romans must have done it.  Before I saw this I was led to believe that the film was nothing but a 2 hour beating and an onslaught of gore.  I won\'t downplay the violence coz it is very violent, but there\'s really only one major beating scene that goes on for some time.  There\'s various beatings along the way, but one major bloody one, and it begins about 50 minutes into the film.  If you watch alot of horror films it may not be as shocking to you as with most other people.  Anyhow, with all religious philosophy put aside, I\'ll say the movie is good.

I am only concerned with the quality of the transfer of this film\'s audio and video from Standard Def to Blu Ray.  Here goes.VIDEO....The transfer to Blu Ray is excellent.  Film grain is not noticeable anywhere and details in the many dark or shadow areas are clearly discernible.  Colors are rich and accurate with no false color grading that I could tell.  Most of the lighting used in the film was shot with fairly warm tones and, even though this films takes place in the mid East, you do not get that golden, overly bright color grading that you see in many of the war and espionage films that take place in the middle East i.e. The Green Zone, Jarhead, The Kingdom and many others.  At no time did I see any  artifacting or aliasing throughout the film.  The film is letterboxed with bars on top and bottom but that doesn\'t bother me.  Mbps rate tends to average in the lower to mid twenties.AUDIO...On Blu Ray you get a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec that, though I was reading the English subtitles, provided for clean and transparent sound.  While there is some directional use of foley fx to the front sides, both the front and rear surrounds are primarily used for ambient crowd noise.  However, they used them well and the audio was definitely immersive in many scenes.  There are a great number of language subtitles to choose from and there is no English dubbing as Mr. Gibson had intended.EXTRAS...While I did not own the Standard Def version, I had seen it a couple of times and it appeared pretty clean to me at the time. Thus, I do not think that this film was wholly remastered for Blu Ray but I do believe that they reformatted it from a very clean mother master.  This is a 2 disc set, I watched the theatrical release.  The other version is supposed to have been edited for kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture.  Other extras include 2 deleted scenes that come without any subtitles but I had no problem getting the gist of what the characters were saying.  The other extras surely came on the Standard Definition release as they were all in a 4:3 aspect ration.  These extras were interviews with Mel Gibson and cast regarding the writing, directing and acting within the film.  Basically, it is one long extra that has been cut into several sub chapters regarding the film.  One extra, which I did try, was a fact pop up which came on during the playing of the movie.  I was expecting historical facts or opinions but the pop ups were either biblical quotations or facts about the lighting, sets, or studio where scenes were shot.

Likewise, we\'re likely to have the same experience because this is in two ancient languages: Aramaic and Latin.I think some of the violence was overdone, but it could have been a lot worse--and it\'s about time we saw a Jesus film that did justice to at least what is cinematic about Our Lord\'s suffering: His physical suffering, in other words.  This goes a long way in feeling like documentary footage, and yet it feels mystical, both with its haunting score and with the choice of slow motion at times.I think some of my biggest problems were some things I didn\'t understand the need for, but the worst are probably where the Tradition appears to have been changed: for example, Jesus appears to be scourged a LOT more than 39 times--in fact, I\'ve read that medical experts have said that the real Jesus probably suffered physically a lot less than we see here.  That is, what we see here is more than enough to have killed Him.  Worse than this, though, is that the Romans who are scourging Our Lord have to be told specifically to stop it, that they were not to scourge Him to death.I\'ll take a brief side note to address the slanderous accusations of \\"anti-Semitism\\" in this movie.  I am Catholic by faith, and Jewish by ethnicity, and I saw no anti-Semitism.  A Roman does pejoratively call Simon of Cyrene \\"Judaeus!\\"  (\\"Jew!\\"), but it\'s clear that our sympathies are to lie with Simon, and with Christ, not with that Roman.  The closest thing to anti-Semitism that I saw was the boys who hound Judas, but I\'m not even sure to what degree that\'s even supposed to be what\'s really happening, rather than in Judas\'s imagination.  It\'s clear that Satan is riling up Jews and Romans alike, and as bad as Jews get here, those portrayed the worst are Romans (though not across the board, so there is no anti-Romanism or anti-Italianism here either).  After all, the worst Jews do to Jesus is beat Him up with their fists and chains, but it is Romans who not only scourge Him (which is historically accurate), but who seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of it, rather than doing what they were ordered to do and at most showing hatred or contempt for this self-proclaimed \\"King of the Jews\\".  The point anyway is Jesus and His suffering, how God turned the greatest evil of Deicide into the greatest good, a Holy Sacrifice to take away the sins of the world.  Why should the depiction of Jews matter more than God, or more than Romans/Italians?  I don\'t hear people complaining about the film being anti-Jewish because it says Jesus is the Son of God (which is what bothered Caiaphas et al about Jesus), nor do I hear the Italian anti-defamation league up in arms over the portrayal of Romans.  So why the cries of anti-Semitism?  We say religious tolerance is a good thing: why does this not apply to Catholics or evangelical Protestants?Having left behind that nonsense, I like the choice of actors here--I didn\'t see Jim Caviezel, I saw Jesus Christ (and I\'d seen Jim Caviezel in Frequency before this).  I also like Maia Morgenstern\'s dignified portrayal of the Virgin Mary, even through Her suffering of com-Passion.  I also liked the portrayals of Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene, and Simon of Cyrene.  And this depiction of Satan was very effective.However, I counted Jesus falling more than three times, so that I lost count with regard to which Station of the Cross we\'re seeing.  Nor did I think it was necessary to dislocate His shoulder to nail His right hand to the Cross.  Also, while I don\'t know for sure, I would have thought the seven words on the Cross would have been in a different order than what we see here exactly.  Also, we don\'t see Jesus buried in the tomb, and the Resurrection scene is ambiguous, and not as well done as I would have liked.Having said that, however, one thing I especially appreciated was when the centurion pierces Our Lord\'s side and the Blood and water literally SPRAY out.  That, I think, is how it ought to be: His lungs had filled up, and so it makes sense that there would have been a burst, and the centurion would have been baptized with it--rather than, as in many depictions, simply showing the Blood and water slowly dripping down.Probably the worst thing about the movie overall is that it wouldn\'t be the best evangelizing tool--it\'s mostly for those who are already familiar with it, to strengthen our faith.  That\'s not a bad thing, it just means the film isn\'t as universal as it might be.  I say it wouldn\'t be the best evangelizing tool because, while Christ\'s message is not entirely absent, it is not necessarily as present as it might be.  We see a flashback of Jesus giving His Sermon on the Mount, telling us to love our enemies, and He gives commands to His disciples at the Last Supper, and of course there is Satan\'s temptation of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, so that this depiction is not anonymous.  Then again, it\'s in a language we don\'t understand, so without subtitles we might get lost--and yet because this is in two languages, we might miss something if we rely entirely on the subtitles (like Pilate addressing Jesus in Aramaic and Jesus responding in Latin).All in all, it has its flaws, but it\'s an excellent movie to watch any Friday, especially during Lent and most especially on Good Friday.God bless you all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Less a movie than moving vignettes of the Sorrowful Mysteries and Stations of the Cross", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}\n',

After watching it, openly crying at two points, and feeling thoroughly drained as a viewer, \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" is not a movie that I will easily forget. It is brutal. It is passionate. It is exquisitely filmed.And yes, it is controversial. But when, in the last few decades, hasn\'t any film made about Jesus attracted controversy? I mean, even satirical films like \\"Dogma\\" or \\"Monty Python\'s Life Of Brian\\" drew the wrath of those who puff up like piranhas should that which they consider sacred get as much as finger pointed in a direction other than how it was mentioned in \\"their\\" Bible. Martin Scorsese\'s \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" brought out so many red meat protesters that I crossed a line of sign carrying fanatics when I went to see it in 1988.There were no protesters at the theater I went to see \\"The Passion\\" at. After the movie ended, I had to sit in my seat for a few minutes and let the tears stop. I felt awful and cleansed at the same time. You can\'t see this movie without remembering that (even to the not so religiously inclined) the story of God\'s plan for his son was to accept the burden of the sins of the world, and die with their weight on his soul.I know there are more than a few who now debate Mel Gibson\'s overt and subliminal motivations behind \\"The Passion\'s\\" strongest and most controversial scenes. As far as anti-Semitism, I didn\'t see it. What I did see was an angry mob whipped into a frenzy by men of power willing to lie to get what they wanted. A quote from Charles Baudelaire kept coming to my mind during that whole courtyard scene: \\"It must not be supposed that the Devil tempts only men of genius. He doubtless despises imbeciles, but he does not disdain their support. Quite on the contrary, he founds his greatest hope upon such people.\\" (It was only later that I thought of a certain litany from a few of our own public officials concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction.)I must also admit, if their were any Romans alive today, they\'d have a case. The soldiers are, for the most part, depicted as drooling sadistic goons who relish the fact that they are ripping the skin right off a man\'s back. They discuss with cold calculation how to nail a man to the cross. Only towards the end do any of them give any indication that something may be seriously amiss with the death of this one man.And there is no lack of sadism here. If you thought \\"Kill Bill Vol. One\\" was a mindless bloodfest, then you really should stay away from \\"The Passion Of The Christ.\\" Mel Gibson makes Tarantino look like a model of restraint here (but if that surprises you, reflect back to the disembowelment scene in \\"Braveheart\\"). The amount of time spent on the scourging of Jesus and the slow motion splatter of running blood and skin is overwhelming, but then again, isn\'t that the point? Jesus suffered for the sins of the world. We just have never been subject to actually seeing it this way on screen before. And yes, I did wonder if it was absolutely necessary to spend almost a third of the movie fixated on the torture of a man.What kept me riveted was what I ultimately feel was \\"The Passion\'s\\" underlying main message after good Vs evil. That would be the love of a mother towards her son. The Mary of the film keeps coming back to her son, and with it we see the pain in her eyes as she watches, all too well understanding, what her son is doing. But we also see her in the flashbacks to life with the son she raised. When James Caviezel, who made a stunningly empathic Jesus, tells her \\"Mother, I make all things new,\\" it is a pivotal moment. For the detractors who say that the film is hollow, they obviously are missing that important subtext.I\'d strongly suggest seeing \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" with somebody else as a support person. I\'d also state that weak stomachs or hearts should stay at home, and small children should NOT be in on this one. If you do not want to spend the money on this movie due to your beliefs, probably all the better for you, but spare me your comments and negative votes if you\'ve not seen the film. Like it or not, Mel Gibson has now proven himself to be a master film maker with \\"The Passion Of The Christ.\\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You will not leave the theater without an opinion.", "unixReviewTime": 1079049600, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2004"}\n',

Some are quick to defend the film, believing it is almost a sign from God. Others have been rather quick to discredit the film, calling it anti-Semitic, overtly violent, and nothing more than a work a religious propaganda. Of course, many of the film\'s supporters and opponents have not seen it, but that\'s another story.Perhaps because of the media attention, I was determined not to see the film, deciding I was already a believer and my faith was strong, one movie would not change what I already believe. I only decided to see the film because people were asking me questions about the film, usually about scenes not found in the Bible. I could not answer them, so I decided to see what the movie.Contrary to what many critics say, Gibson does follow the basic story lines of the gospels. He also adds material from medieval passion plays which do not distort the story. He adds some materials from a visionary, and many of these details give the movie a somewhat creepy feeling. Poetic license, maybe, but does it detract? No. Basically Gibson, as a person of faith, presents his version of the story of Christ\'s last hours. In this regard he\'s no different from Cecil B. De Mille who added material to the Exodus account for THE TEN COMMANDMENTS or Franco Zefferelli who also took liberties with JESUS OF NAZARETH. Both of these works are considered classics, and both inspire faith and we don\'t seem to mind that neither is completely accurate, so why the uproar with the Gibson film?From the point of view of cinematography, the film has many excellent features. We get a sense of place throughout the film. Light is used effectively and throughout the film there is a mood that Gibson creates that tells us something is happening. I will be interesting to see if it is nominated for any Academy awards. The film making certainly merits it.Now, as far as the criticisms leveled against the film. Are they accurate? Is the film a piece of religious propaganda? I suppose this depends on point of view. If I took someone who is not a believer to the film, that person might be inclined to say yes, but for many people, the film can help a person come to a deeper understanding of Christ\'s last hours. Is the film violent? Yes, but there are far more violent films that have been released. Perhaps these are not religious films, but we have to keep in mind, a crucifixion is not a cake walk. The Romans soldiers had little in common with Rebecca of Sunny Brook Farm. Let\'s be realistic here. We also have to remember it is an \\"R\\" rated film, and with good reason. It\'s not kid fare. Should it include the entire life of Jesus? Well, we don\'t object when a film only tells of Jesus\' birth, or his miracles, or his teachings. So why should we object to a film just about the Passion? Is it offensive to Jewish people? Here is where I did have some objections to the film. Gibson does not do as good enough job separating the religious leaders who opposed Jesus (scripture tells us not all leaders opposed him; Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were both Pharisees and religious leaders) from the average Jewish person. Judas is presented as a bit too overtly money grubbing. Intelligent people would not come away from this film with anti-Jewish feelings, but in the hands of an anti-Semite, there could be some fuel for hatred.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perhaps the Years Most Controversial Film", "unixReviewTime": 1079049600, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2004"}\n',

Coming out of this movie, my faith was more intensified by what was probably the most graphic and yet closely accurate depiction of Jesus\' last 12 hours on earth.  But the real deal I want to get to is the fact that it was not Jews that put Jesus to the cross nor was it the Roman soldiers, it was humanity.  Our sins and our disobedience to God is what did it.  People can say that based on this interpretation, Jesus\' own people sentenced him to be crucified or that the Romans were made to be like drunk lunatics.  But I see it as a showcase of how deep our sin, as one race, got and it needed someone of the stature of Jesus Christ to go through this torture and death to be purged of that.  THAT\'s what this was about.  It was a message of sacrifice and a message of love, something that was even told well through flashbacks to the Passover dinner and the sermon on the Mount.The acting was good and each role filled out just wonderful.  James Caviezel played the Jesus character unbelievably well, showing the Son of God as human as he can be through his fears of what\'s to come but yet the courage to fulfill the will of God for the sake of his people.  Mary Magdalene was done well too and I couldn\'t help but feel what she was feeling when the whipping began.  And the actress for Satan was just plain freaky.  Satan never really talked much but you always felt Satan\'s presence throughout each key point in the movie.  I personally thought the scene with Judas\' betrayal and death was done very good with the kids tugging and tugging him during his guilt trip.  Overall here, the acting was good enough in that everyone was showing their anguish over what was being done.Now for the gory parts: I personally felt it wasn\'t that gory.  I\'m not trying to put down the suffering Jesus went through because God knows I would not want to go through that at all.  But there are hundreds of horror and suspense flicks out there that just pour buckets of blood that I would not recommend to the weak of heart and this one would not be on that same level with those flicks in terms of spilt blood.  BUT it was graphic in the sense that Mel Gibson made every whipping and each nail that pierced Jesus\' flesh look real, nothing watered down, like you actually felt the pain (I really cringed on that one whip shot that you most likely know of).  So it was more of a psychological sense of intense violence in that it was bloody and it felt real.A couple of weaknesses I could point out would be explaining a couple of scenes to the non-believers.  I\'m not sure they\'ll understand why Satan was carrying a disfigured baby during the whipping (I still don\'t understand that part either) or why Satan was screaming from the depths of hell.  It\'s not an entirely big deal but it would help to flesh out why this is occurring, even for a few more seconds but I know Mel wouldn\'t want to go off on tangents.Overall, this is something that needs to be seen, whether you\'re Christian or not.  I think if you can open your heart to this message that this could be a life-changing experience for the non-believer and a faith-strengthening experience for the believer.  Put aside the controversies you\'ve heard of this being spiteful towards Jews and realize what WE as human beings have done to Him.  WE persecuted Him and WE nailed him to the cross.  This movie is about what one man went through to save us from sin and is a demonstration of the depth of God\'s awesome and abundant love for us, that He is willing to part away of His own Son, to have him suffer so much because of the depths of our sin, to release us from that very sin.

Tisthammer \\"Minnesotan\\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "The Passion of the Christ depicts the last twelve hours before his crucifixion and death.  But what about some of the stuff before that?  Fortunately, there are multiple flashbacks so that it can cover a little more ground.The movie begins with haunting music together with dark and cool color themes (color themes are used often in the movie).  At night, a bright blue moon with thick layers of mist on the dark garden, appropriately matching the given scene of Gethsemane.  With all the dialogue in Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin (don\'t worry; there are English subtitles) and the ethereal music, there is an intensely artistically feel throughout the movie, to the extent it is somewhat difficult for one to enjoy or dislike the movie in any conventional sense.  Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing the film, on par with his Oscar winning movie Braveheart.  Gibson, I think, has earned at least a nomination with this film.The depth of the character of Jesus is developed more fully than most movies on the life of Christ and greatly emphasizes his humanity.  Here we see Jesus not just a stoic and solemn teacher, but also facets of definite fear and reluctance in the sacrifice he is called to make for humanity, and not wanting the other disciples (only three were with him at the scene at Gethsemane) to see him like this.  Flashbacks later show him in lighthearted moods of cheerfulness and even playfulness.  Jesus really does come across as very human character, even though the divine aspect is not neglected in the film.What about historical accuracy?  I\'ll mention a few points here.  Pontius Pilate is plausibly portrayed.  If he does not execute Jesus, he fears a rebellion from Caiphas.  But if he does execute Jesus, he fears that Jesus\' followers may start a rebellion.  Either way, he fears that we will get in trouble with Caesar (a rebellion would not make Pilate look in control of the region) and thus tries to walk a tightrope somewhere in between.  This is reasonable since in 31 C.E. Pilate\'s protector/patron Sejanus fell from power because he was plotting against the emperor.  This would have made Pilate\'s position very weak in 33 C.E. (the date Jesus was probably crucified), so it\'s quite reasonable that he would have been unusually careful to prevent getting into further trouble with Caesar.  The crucifixion however is less realistic however.  Jesus would most likely have been nailed at the wrists, not in the palms as we see in some traditional paintings.For those of you wanting their kids to see this movie, I should remind you that it is rated R for a very good reason.  The violence is brutally realistic when Jesus is scourged.  When it\'s all done, there appear to be hundreds of bloody lacerations all over his body.  And on top of this there is of course the crown of thorns and being nailed to the cross.I would be remiss in my review if I did not say something about the anti-Semitism that supposedly exists in this film. There are a couple of problems with this charge.  One, it was by far the Roman gentiles-not the Jews-who were the most vicious, sardonic and sadistic people in the movie.Second there is the crucial question: were the Jews portrayed in a negative light?  An oversimplified \\"yes\\" would hardly do the matter justice.  Yes, some Jews were-but many were not.  By mentioning only the instances of a negative portrayal of Jews, some critics make the movie seem a lot more one-sided than it really is.So what are the favorable portrayals of Jews?  There is of course the fact that the protagonist and his most loyal followers were Jewish (a fact often overlooked by Anti-Semites who call themselves Christians).  The Jewishness of the women followers was particularly emphasized with some brief Passover dialogue.  Additionally, Mel Gibson went \\"out of his way\\" (included material not in the gospels) to show that these Jewish enemies of Jesus were not representative of all Jews.  For instance, the movie showed a dissenting member of the Sanhedrin.  \\"Who called the meeting anyway?  And at this hour of the night?  Where are the other members of the council?\\"  As the crowd pushed him out of the meeting, the Jewish priest denounced the whole meeting as a \\"beastly travesty!\\"  Furthermore, the movie made it most explicitly clear that Simon of Cyrene was a Jew, and he was ultimately seen as a compassionate man, very sympathetic towards the suffering of Jesus.  This Jewish man who was not a follower of Jesus was actually more virtuous than any of the gentiles in the movie.Any unfavorable aspects of the DVD?  Unfortunately, yes.  Probably the most disappointing aspect of this DVD is the complete lack of any special features.  On the main menu, there are only the options of playing the film in addition to the language and scene selections.  (Though there is a nice feature for the visually impaired.)  Granted, given the seriousness of the matter, humorous outtakes might not have been appropriate.  But even still, something like a little director commentary would have been nice.

Telling the story of Jesus\' last 12 hours, from the Gardens of Gesthamane to his blink of an eye ressurection, this movie imbeds the message of Christianity as powerfully as the nails that punctured Christ. By the end of the movie, almost everybody was in tears and was moved beyond comparison. My own father had to \\"Depressure\\" for about an hour to get all the sadness of this movie out of his system. I praise Mel Gibson for never giving up for what he believed in or caving in to controversy, because this is the most vivid and accurate account of The Last 12 Hours of Christ that has been potrayed to this day.Acting: The acting throughout this movie is top-notch even though it was cast in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, so you have to rely on English subtitles to translate the words. The acting is dark, and the actors voices make your heart beat faster every time they talk. Jim Caviezel is the perfect choice for Jesus, as his voice seems to stand out from all the others, but towards the end he just grunts and doesn\'t do all that much, but thats forgiveable. The standout in acting in my opinion came from Maia Morgenstern, who plays the brooding and grief-stricken Mary, who follows Jesus on his path to the cross and is by him until he utters his last words to her. Monica Belluci and whoever plays James play great supporting roles and really added to the movie. Also I love how the Devil follows Jesus to the cross and the scene where she is holding the Anti-Christ is one of the most memorable.Directing: Mel Gibson does an absolutely excellent job directing,as he pours his heart out into this movie. The way he casts a gloomy atmosphere over the movie will make most critics swoon. I loved the camera work(Especially the slow-mo shots) and I thought that I really was in Jerusalem 2000 years ago with the vivid images that you see. Excellent!

That all changes with \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".I don\'t want to get into the nit-picking of this film, as in all honesty I do not have a strong scriptural grasp on all the passages that director Mel Gibson tries to portray, but instead I view it from just one perspective: Beginning with the night that Jesus was taken into Roman custody until the stone was rolled away from the tomb, this film is a very visceral interpretation of one possible scenario that may have played out.  It is sort of like a \\"historical-fiction\\" telling of the crucifixion story, as no one knows exactly what transpired.From a plot perspective, the film doesn\'t at all delve into the meaning of Jesus\' crucifixion (to save the world from their sins so we can join him in heaven someday), but takes a \\"just the facts, m\'am\\" approach to the story.  Jesus is captured by the Romans, tried by King Herod and Pontius Pilate, beaten mercilessly and humiliated, and then crucified...the end.  The violent acts committed during these scenes are startling, to say the least, yet they do shed light on how difficult a process this was for Jesus to endure, as (at the time) he was confined to a mortal body and bound by its limitations.Thus, if you are at all squeamish about bloody violence, steer clear of this film at all costs.  However, if you are a veteran of, say, the \\"Saw\\" films and would like a more realistic portrayal of the single most important moment in human history, this is your film.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Will Give You Pause To Think About The Reality Of The Crucifixion", "unixReviewTime": 1260748800, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2009"}\n',

The story begins with Dr. Carson being asked to consider operating on the two sons of a German couple who are joined at the abdomen and skull. No one has ever performed this surgery successfully with both children surviving. The film then flashes back to the childhood of Dr. Carson. He was raised by an illiterate but very loving and determined single mother who married at the age of 13 and was divorced soon after when she discovered her \'husband\' was married at the same time to another woman with another family. She was determined that her two sons would not turn out the same way she did. It is an amazing story of this mother and her love and determination. Ben, not realizing he needed glasses, consistently performed way below the other students in class until his mother used all their savings to get him a pair. That, along with her firm hand in making the two boys read two books a week from the library (along with written reports) as well as limiting TV watching to two programs a week turned Ben into the \'student of the year\' in 8th grade. Even that, however, was tainted, as a teacher at the award ceremony berated the other students for letting a \'boy of color\' with serious disadvantages and a single mother outperform them. The story continues with his achievements and struggles through high school and his scholarship years at Yale and on to his residency at Johns Hopkins. The story then takes us back to the conclusion of the decision whether or not to operate on the German twins. It is an incredible story of someone who not only had the \'gifted hands\' needed to be a great surgeon but also the determination, humility and faith to make a life of great service to his fellow humans against great odds. The acting is outstanding. I would encourage everyone and every family to make this a \'must watch\'. I would also highly recommendSomething the Lord Made, another story about a great African-American surgeon, Dr. Vivian Thomas, who was born 30 years too early to be able to have the same opportunities as Dr. Carson, but nevertheless made a great contribution to medicine that is still being used today.

Her husband, a drug user is not seen but all to often that is the plague that lays waste to families in this country.  Cuba Golding is at his very best here as Ben Carson.

They both feature Cornish seaside ancestral homes, and they both explore confusing erotic triangles involving the dead and the living. Fittingly, both novels were turned into great Hollywood Gothic films; though the film of REBECCA is one of the most famous of all films from Hollywood\'s Golden Age, MY COUSIN RACHEL is far less well known today, although it is as powerful and may even be as great. Like REBECCA, it also features an unforgettable score by Franz Waxman (which can be beautifully isolated on this Twilight Time limited edition DVD), and great costumes, set design, and especially cinematography. The parallels seem to have struck the studio too, since Twentieth-Century Fox cast Olivia de Havilland, the sister of Joan Fontaine (the lead in Paramount\'s REBECCA), in the title role, and in the male lead, instead of Laurence Olivier (the Max de Winter of the 1940 Hitchcock film), Richard Burton, who in his debut film performance here very much recalls Olivier.Why the film is not better known today is hard to say, and may have something to do with its setting in the very early Victorian period: certainly this was not the most attractive era for women\'s fashions, and De Havilland\'s hairstyle in her early scenes (in braids coiled round her ears, like Princess Leia) could not flatter anyone. But when her hair is brought down later in the film she shows herself as still one of the greatest beauties of Hollywood\'s Golden Age, and her intensity and fine Method training in the Forties serve her in excellent stead too. Originally Fox was said to have wanted Vivien Leigh for the role of Rachel Sangeletti, and though she certainly would have given a more carnal performance than De Havilland (whose exquisite diction is perhaps not put to its best use as the sensual Rachel), she could not have played the role with more intelligence--always De Havilland\'s best asset as a mature actress. As Philip, the nephew of Rachel\'s first husband (and like the elder man Rachel\'s cousin), Burton sometimes recalls Olivier\'s worst tendencies, such as his habit of speaking too quickly and loudly when he\'s angry, such that Burton\'s explosive scene in the church with Audrey Dalton is overdone. But he is here at his most beautiful, and he exhibits an almost palpable passion before De Havilland (reportedly the two did not get along, which may have given heat to their many scenes together).The film\'s greatest asset, however is Nunnelly Johnson\'s relative fidelity to Du Maurier\'s beautifully constructed story. Was Rachel innocent, or was she guilty? MY COUSIN RACHEL is ambiguous in ways even REBECCA was not, and dares to suggest that this key question may ultimately unanswerable. Philip believes Rachel has murdered his cousin, but like his cousin becomes so besotted by her he cannot refuse her anything--his money, his family\'s jewels, even his own hand in marriage... which the wily Rachel is of course far too canny to accept. Twilight Time made only 3000 copies of this DVD edition, and it is absolutely worth buying.

It also does a great job at exposing the way-too-comfortable relationship between the Nazis and the Soviets during 1939-41. And it definitely demonstrated that there was anti-Semitism in both the Nazi and Soviet camps.All that being stated, I have 3 problems with this documentary.1) In terms of just providing balance, it would\'ve been worth noting the heroism of the Red Army between 1941-45 in stopping Nazi aggression and providing a solid Eastern Front (at the cost of over 14 million soldiers) that helped the Allies as a whole defeat Nazi Germany. Even the most right-wing person could recognize that the Allies\' task of defeating Hitler would\'ve been much harder, if not impossible, without the tremendous help from the Soviets. Yes, the Red Army committed atrocities too (as did the other Allies to a much smaller extent) but it was part of the necessary war to defeat Hitler.2) The idea of the Nazis being just \\"junior Communists\\" is just ludicrous. Yes, both believed in totalitarian systems. Yes both believed in murder and repression in order to maintain rule. However, the Nazis were \\"Socialist\\" in name only (and that was to acquire votes in German elections prior to 1933). Hitler despised Bolshevism (and what he called Judeo Bolshevism). Hitler\'s idol was Frederick the Great (hint, not a Socialist) and Hitler wanted a return to a \\"Prussian\\" empire. He considered as friends Mussolini and Franco and backed Franco and his Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. The Soviets supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. If the Nazis and Soviets were so \\"chummy\\", then how come Hitler decided to launch Operation Barbarossa in the first place (the documentary completely neglects this)? Why did Stalin respond with such ferocity (the documentary completely neglects this too)?3) Marx/Engles may have called for mass executions and Lenin did order executions be carried, but neither one is on the scale or ideology of Stalin. Stalin was his own creature and not a blind follower of Marxist-Leninist ideology. In fact, while Stalin claimed to support the beliefs of the Marxist-Leninists, he had no problem ordering the executions of many of them including Trotsky, who denounced him, and Kirov, who supported him but was too much of a threat. Stalin has more in common with Ivan the Terrible than he does with Lenin. It\'s quite telling that all the original Party members ended up dead under Stalin\'s rule (with Trotsky, I believe, being the last holdout). The documentary paints the picture that it was the teachings of Marx-Engles and Lenin that drove Stalin to cause the deaths of over 20 million Russians which denies Stalin\'s own psychological makeup as the true cause of this scale of death. It\'s quite telling that when Khrushchev took power after Stalin\'s death, he set out to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union but kept Marx and Lenin in, implying just how rogue Stalin was.This documentary would\'ve been more credible if it just focused on Stalin, his atrocities, and the troubling thought that there are people in Russia (including its leaders) today who are willing to ignore these atrocities altogether and focus on how \\"great\\" Stalin was. \\"Blood on the Snow\\" is a much better documentary for this.

Although I\'ve been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that\'s my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley\'s voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff\'s song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That\'s not a bad thing.

Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very \'amateur\', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you\'re a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as \'Lilac Wine\' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn\'t that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a \'Discography\' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he\'s ever worked on (such as \'Sketches\' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn\'t diminished in its\' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today.

The soloists are American soprano Judith Blegen, German bass baritone Michael Holl, Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza and Italian mezzo-soprano Irene Molinari, all top soloists of the 1980\'s.Many reviewers have complained against Amazon for not listing this work in this recording but introduced the Second Violin Concerto as the sole piece of work in this DVD.I report that in a new version of this same release, the cover even escalated this aspect by showing Anne-Sophie Mutter and Karajan, without any marked reference to the Magnificat.I watched the Concerto part with considerable fast forwards, as the performance isn\'t really as riveting as other Anne-Sophie Mutter recordings (I don\'t know why).I had to agree that the major artistic and entertainment attraction of this release lies in the Magnificat in D, BWV 243.The soloists are all wonderful - Blegen with an angelic tone, Molinari with an earthly plaint, Araiza firily energetic with Holl sounding plangent and authoritative.The chorus sung tremendously well under Karajan, who conducts from the keyboard.If I had not watched excerpts of this part on Youtube, I would NEVER have known this jewel of a performance hidden in this DVD FOR THE NO 2 VIOLIN CONCERTO.Who would have guessed that it was there?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Who would have guessed it was there - look out for Karajan\'s SECOND Magnificat BWV 243 here!", "unixReviewTime": 1374451200, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2013"}\n',

Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I\'ve dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan\'s direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don\'t think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don\'t think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It\'s like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.

I was a bit hesitant to try it because I don\'t generally like aerobics videos--I find all that &quot;take it from the top&quot; really boring--but I\'m glad I gave this workout a chance.  At the start of the video, Ketih Cooke, a well-known kickboxer, provides main instructor Kathy Smith with simple explanations of each of the punches and kicks that will be used in the workout.  This brief overview was helpful, but once you learn the moves, you can skip over this part.Following the instructive segment, Kathy Smith takes over.  The workout begins with a warmup which lasts about 10 minutes.  This provides the opportunity for you to get used to the movements, but don\'t be fooled by the &quot;warmup&quot; label--your heart rate will definitely be elevated during this section, and you will sweat!  Next comes the 25-minute kickboxing workout.  During this section, you will practice punches and kicks, starting slowly and then building up to a faster pace.  Kathy was easy to follow, and she gradually worked up to basic punch-kick combinations which were simple to learn yet to fun to do.  I did find myself getting pretty tired during this segment, but I was able to keep up by modifying the intensity slightly (eg, keeping my feet on the ground during the hops from side to side).  At the end of this section, two short combinations are presented by Keith Cooke and another well-known instructor, Keli Roberts.  I liked that these combinations were a bit different yet still easy to learn and that the repetitions of each were kept to a minimum.  Throughout the workout, there were times when I felt like I might not be doing the moves exactly right, but I still enjoyed myself--all that punching and kicking felt GOOD!After the kickboxing workout ends, there is a 5-minute section focusing on the legs and glutes.  In this segment, you practice the kicks more slowly, combining them with squats and holding on to a chair for balance.  This was a nice way to reinforce what you learned during the workout, and I think that continued practice of this section will help to improve my kickboxing skills.  Finally, the workout ends with a 5-minute cool down performed seated in a chair.  These moves provided nice stretches for the thighs and glutes (although at one point, Kathy forgets to perform a squat stretch on the opposite side), and when they were over, I felt thoroughly stretched.I can\'t compare this video to Tae Bo, as I\'ve never tried those workouts.  However, I CAN say that this was a fun, high-energy video that left me feeling strong and powerful rather than exhausted.  It was perfect for a kickboxing beginner like me, but it was also challenging enough to provide even non-beginners with a great workout.  Kathy Smith has a nice, easygoing style and provides good overall instruction.  There were a few times when I thought she failed to adequately cue a change in movement, but the workout was so easy to follow along that it wasn\'t hard to replicate the movements after the first repetition or two.  I\'m thrilled to have finally found a cardio video that is truly enjoyable, and I look forward to doing this video as part of my regular rotation.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So THIS is why people love kickboxing!", "unixReviewTime": 1081987200, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2004"}\n',

Though I used to do Tae Bo religiously, my cardio routine fell by the wayside when we moved into a new house and [insert excuse after excuse here; reason #1 being that our new home has all-concrete floors and it took us a few months to outfit the gym with an appropriate mat]. Anyway, when I vowed to start back up again, I quickly decided against resuming Tae Bo. What with its quick switches between moves, sometimes confusing instructions, and uneven editing, I suspect that Tae Bo was a little too rough on my knees and ankles. Instead, I thought I might check out Kathy Smith\'s workout; I have some of her other videos, including a few light weight workouts, and enjoy them...well, as much as one can enjoy an exercise DVD.Kathy Smith\'s Kickboxing Workout is just what I needed - an excellent workout for beginners. If you\'re new to cardio and/or kickboxing, the 45-minute Basic workout is challenging but not impossibly so. Smith starts with a slow warm up, leads you into a moderately-paced workout (roughly 20 minutes in length), and then cools things down with a short \\"buns and thighs kicking drills\\" segment, followed by a \\"cool down stretch\\" and an \\"abs and back strengthening\\" workout. The run time is just over 45 minutes. I have a few minor quibbles - for example, switching or adding moves in the middle of a routine, which seems to me a no-no for beginners - but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, it\'s great.If you\'re expecting a more difficult routine from the 55-minute Challenge workout, forget it. Instead of putting together an entirely new routine for more experienced students - which is what I expected - Smith just adds two extra segments to the Basic workout and calls it a \\"Challenge.\\" Keith Cooke leads the added ten minutes of footage, which is divided into two segments: \\"Kickboxing Stances\\" (a review of the postures, which can hardly be called \\"challenging\\") and \\"Challenge\\" (a few new combinations, again not super-difficult or especially intense). As much as I love the Basic workout, I\'m super-disappointed in the Challenge; whereas I thought this might be a new routine I could move onto once I\'d mastered the Basic workout, it\'s really just more of the same. Increased difficulty isn\'t just about endurance, but intensity too.  4/5 stars, with a point lost for the \\"Challenge\\" half of this DVD.Also, can the class please stop wearing baggy pants?

A variety of different punches and kicks are incorporated into cardio routines that get the heart rate up and make you feel invincible!  I like how Kathy starts out by discussing safety with martial arts expert Keith Cooke.  One important she and Keith stress throughout the workout is go at your own pace and not worry about kicking high or punching super hard.After the 10 minute warm-up, Kathy goes into a high-energy 25-minute workout.  I like how she introduces the leg work (e.g. pivots) before she introduces the punches, focusing on good form. She also doesn\'t go straight into kicking (she does &quot;side folds&quot; to prepare you for the kicks).  Throughout the tape you see clips of Keith doing the kicks and punches from different angles to help have good form.  As a bonus, the tape includes thigh and buns kicking drills and back and abs stability exercises.When I first started doing the workout, I felt that she didn\'t cue on time and would announce a new adjustment after she started doing it.  However, after doing the workout a couple of times, I knew what to expect so it wasn\'t as much of an issue.  I find the workout highly addictive and the time flies by really quickly.

As a belly dancer, I had no problem with the concept of hip motion, but my teacher frequently told me I had to \\"tone it down a bit,\\" and I was also finding the salsa rhythm particularly hard to follow. All of that changed as a consequence of using this DVD.Like any other aerobic dance workout, this one may be a bit challenging for beginners with no dance background. You will simply have to be patient, do a little bit at a time and backtrack on occasion. However, this workout will soon become effortless for you if you have any dance background at all.Kathy\'s transitions are smooth, and her choice of steps is very appropriate for a lightweight, fun workout. By the fourth or fifth run-through with this workout, I found that the time was just flying by and I was doing the movements more and more automatically. One day, I finished the workout and realized that I hadn\'t thought at all about doing the steps correctly. They had simply happened naturally as I followed Kathy\'s lead and listened to the music. It dawned on me that I understood the salsa rhythm perfectly well on an intuitive level, and that Latin dance would come natrually to me if I just relaxed and stopped obsessing about every step.Another reason that I enjoy this DVD is that it is SOLID Latin dance. Personally, I don\'t go along with the current trend toward \\"mix it up\\" workouts with 15 minutes of Latin, 15 of Hip HOp, etc. When I\'m in the mood to do Latin, I find it very frustrating to have to switch to jazz or Hip Hop right at the point where I\'m just getting \\"in the groove.\\"It\'s like shifting gears to go up a hill when you are having a nice smooth bike ride.

Friends have asked for years how vocalists scream for three hours a night, a couple hundred times a year, and still have enough voice remaining to order a pizza on friday.

On the same note, there are those who have other preferences in music, thats fine too.

The value of the DVD is excellent because you can actually see how the exercises need to be performed, as well as hearing them.  I also liked watching Melissa because she\'s very colorful and dynamic, and it makes you feel like you have your own vocal coach.  How someone can learn to sing from a book is beyond me.  The DVD also features actual footage of vocal chords in action.  Melissa apparently swallowed a tiny camera and sang the correct and incorrect ways.  It\'s very interesting to see the theory in action.The package also comes with an audio CD that features warm-up exercises in different vocal ranges.  A very nice addition.  The production value of the whole package is excellent.  I have seem some obvious \\"vocal lesson\\" scams on the internet that look like they were produced in someone\'s basement in an afternoon.  This package is very professional, and contains a lot of content.The three drawbacks I have to this package (and the only two reasons I gave it four stars instead of five) are as follows: (1) There is too much promotional information on the DVD.  Throughout the entire video, various band members interviewed in clubs and back alleys keep singing the praises of Melissa and telling you how great she is.  I felt a little like, \\"Hey, I already bought the DVD, you don\'t need to sell me on it.  Get on with the program!\\"  (2) The video was a little too focused on death metal and hardcore garbage-disposal vocals.  I was hoping there would be more discussion of the styles of say Joe Cocker, Bruce Springsteen, or Steven Tyler (Aerosmith).  Although I can see that death metal singers are probably the most aggressive, they don\'t have a monopoly on singing with passion, \\"fire\\" and \\"heat\\" (as the video calls the techniques).  (3) Ironically, The Zen of Screaming didn\'t cover as much \\"screaming\\" as I wanted.  It seems like only the last chapter of the DVD really focused on what I bought the video for: How to sing aggressively without hurting your vocal chords.  The vast majority of the video was spent on essential fundamentals (which were no doubt important), but I could have used another 10-15 minutes of discussion on how the \\"heat\\" and \\"fire\\" techniques really works.Overall, I would highly recommend this program.

Get over that and you find a great story, with remarkable work done well enough to encourage a purchase. \'HOMELESS for the HOLIDAYS\',written-directed-produced by George A. Johnson, was reported in the news to have received a TV syndication deal. Perhaps even greater things ahead for this do-all Johnson and his wife Karen, who seemed, according to the credits, to have even more jobs than George.The story is very timely. An up-and-coming marketing expert, Jack Baker, is forced to take the blame (unfairly) for an error in product labeling which sent a couple hundred uses to the hospital. The error: \\"Do NOW inhale fumes\\" placed on a cleaning product. That\'s a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the story is very convincing. It was based on a true story. Of course, with no income, the affluent family struggles, and is destined to be homeless by Christmas Day. The Wooded Falls community (actual filming taking place in several towns of northeast Indiana) has unemployment at 7% (low for 2010 reality). In the end this family of 4 learns what is truly important about Christmas and even more about caring for others, giving, and peace. A very good ending. It earned a 5 DOVE rating.Matt Moore (actor turned Indiana pastor) plays Jack. Matt is an Adam Sandler look-alike sound-alike person who does a great job. Wife Sheryl (Crystal DeWitt-Hinkle) is more convincing in her lovable scenes than her troubled moments but still gets the job done. Siblings Adam (Cole Brandenberger) & Michelle (Gabrielle Phillips) seem to know their way around the film, even looking good in the auditions bonus feature. David Sisco played Wesley & Brad Stine a grocery manager; both doing so well you found them totally annoying, as you were supposed to.

The kids are all pretty tight as many youth group kids are with the exception of Ashley.  Ashley is a beautiful girl who has a bit of a self-centered attitude.  She is going on the trip because her grandma is pushing her to go.  Her attitude is to just get through it.  This annoys Carrie to bits.  She doesn\'t appreciate Ashley\'s snobbishness and has her own preconceived notions about the new addition.  Steve however thinks that Ashley is just misunderstood and needs a chance.  Of course with a big chip on her shoulder, Ashley doesn\'t make it easy for anyone to give her that chance.  She feels no one understands her or what she has gone through.Things don\'t go terribly well with the kids and Stuart decides to share the story of Hosea and Gomer with the kids.  The story of Hosea is a story of God\'s love for His stiff necked, rebellious and disloyal people.Amazing Love is two stories in one.  The main one really is the telling of Hosea and Gomer.  The secondary, story involving the kids really unfolds first.  That part is good, but the real heart and soul that is going to get you is Hosea.  What is cool though is how in the end, it all really intertwines so well together.  Hosea learned how God felt when Israel turned their backs on Him and worshiped false idols.  He felt it on the level of being a man married to and in love with a woman who was completely unfaithful to him.  There was a line in the story that really hit home for me where Hosea is talking with God in anguished prayer not understanding how God would love this unlovable people who did not act loving toward Him.  He said \\"You love us because your love is not dependent on us.\\"  Awesome right?I am going to stop here in order to not give much away.  Although let\'s face it, you can read Hosea and get the gist of that story, but this one is really told well.  Yep, I kind of cried a bit.The movie  does not have difficult themes for kids.

Highlights of vengeance include extreme facial surgery involving a group of hungry rats,  poison tipped bullets and the previous mentioned incident where the local gangster is quite literally turned into a string of sausages. Even the family dog doesn\'t escape unharmed in this one folks!With the varying amounts of violence on display, it is no wonder that the film has suffered numerous cuts over the years, however it is the gritty realism of the film itself rather than any one particular gore scene which ultimately unnerves the viewer and actually makes for a pretty good story beneath all of the carnage.Released on Blu-ray by Synapse Films on a region free disc, the film is presented in its fully uncut directors print which features all of the gore excised from previous releases. Synapse have gone to town on this release and have invested in a brand new 2k scan from the original materials which has produced a quality 1080p 1.78:1 transfer of the film that put simply is stunning. Detail is sharper than ever before with colours and black levels appearing really well defined. Film grain is rightfully present throughout the picture which only enhances the overall atmosphere and for anyone who is used to watching previous versions of the movie, this new print will be a revelation.Audio tracks are available in a choice of DTS Mono and original restored Stereo mixes, both of which are trouble free and sound clear and well balanced. Admittedly the low budget roots of the film will ensure that the soundtrack will never compete with the latest modern day blockbusters, however there really is nothing to complain about here, with both dialogue and action scenes being clean and well represented.Extras wise there is not a great deal available in this package, however what is here is largely very good. Firstly there is an informative commentary track by the films director which covers every conceivable angle relating to the films production, locations, release and even his personal views on the films sequel. As far as commentaries go this really is one of the better ones and fans of the film will find plenty of interest. Rounding this off, there are the usual theatrical trailers and  some TV spots which also make a nice addition. Although a couple of extra documentaries would have been most welcome, the excellent commentary track more than makes up for any shortfall.All things considered, this Blu-ray release should be considered as a must buy purchase for fans of the film. Casual viewers will also find plenty to like and as a classic example of 1980\'s exploitation movie making, the film still has plenty to offer. With a UK Blu-ray release coming soon from Arrow Video which is said to use the same quality transfer and contain additional extra features, there is a clear choice to import this US release or wait until November for the UK disc. Worth noting however is that the Arrow release contains an altogether different audio commentary track with the films producer and at this time it remains unconfirmed whether the original Stereo soundtrack option will be present on their release. For real fans of the film or for people who remain undecided there is of course always the option of a double purchase.One things for certain The Exterminator has never looked or sounded better, further proving that older low budget films really can have a new lease of life on Blu-ray.\\"If You\'re Lying.....I\'ll Be Back!\\"BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of the less mainstream releases find us on Facebook or at blureviewobscura .yolasite .com", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Blu Review 46 - The Exterminator", "unixReviewTime": 1315180800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2011"}\n',

If you are like me, I always carry tension in my neck/shoulders. At times, I can feel myself squeezing my shoulders to my ears.  This yoga video helps me to release tension because the instructor is always reminding us to breath, roll our shoulders back, and to let go...  Ahhhhh, it is a starting place!!!  This yoga routine is very basic and includes poses like the warrior and downward dog.  The main focus is on leg stretches so this would be a good video for a runner.I gave the video 5 stars for the following reasons:(1) Sara reminds you to breath--this is central to yoga.(2) All poses are clearly demonstrated. The camera angles are great so you can see how the pose is suppose to be done correctly.(3) Alternative poses are clearly demonstrated by another instructor. You actually get to *SEE* your options (other yoga videos will not always demonstrate these alternatives).  So you can go at your own pace and modify the program to suit your needs.(4) Clocking in around 30 minutes, this video is quick and fairly easy so it is easy to incorporate into your daily schedule.NOTE:  One of the reviewers complained that the instructor is patronizing and/or too friendly.  Sara has a very soothing tone, she speaks to remind you to breath and to explain how to position yourself correctly. She also smiles throughout the video--so she is not intimidating at all. I personally found her to be a great instructor because I felt like she wanted me to learn the proper techniques of yoga.  But you must decide if these attributes sound annoying to you.

Its really a follow up to MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA. This is the first release, in the US, of the unedited Japanese version. For competists, the strangely reedited US version has also been included. Both versions are entertaining.This is the first time team up of Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra against the alien dragon King Ghidorah (aka Ghidrah). Along for the ride are the twin faeries fromMothra\'s island who, telepathically orchestrate the colaboration. There is also a amnesiac Himalayan princess who is also a cross dressing Martian prophetess; three Blues Brothers look-alike assasins who are out tofinish her off and a tough police detective who wants to save her and his sister who wants to restore her memory. Basically, it tries to play like a Hitchcock thriller or an early Bond film. In the end the espianage plotand the monster plot come together. This is the first time that Godzilla swithches from menace to hero.The first half of the film is basically \\"GODZILLA VS. RODAN\\", with the two \\"bad\\" monsters convinced to \\"turn good\\" by the intelligent and telepathic Mothra. The following film MONSTER ZERO is basically a direct sequel to this with Godzilla and Rodan reteaming to fight Ghidorah in the futuristic (at the time at least) 1980s.These are the GODZILLA titles not yet available on DVD, and that have no current release dates:GODZILLA VS.

I love the story line to the movie, a princess who\'s uncle wants to kill her is coming to japan for safety, when she jumps off an airplane they think she is dead but she comes back controlled by the Venus people(or martians in the american version) and she predicts the return of Godzilla, and Rodan, and pretty much most of the movie is Godzilla vs. Rodan. But then King Ghidorah comes, who she tells destroyed her home world, and Godzilla Rodan and Mothra team up. I loved how they re-used the original Mothra Vs. Godzilla suit, it was my favorite from the showa era suit. But this movie isn\'t all perfect, i didn\'t like how the godzilla theme from this movie was mashed with rodans and was used for the rest of the movie. I wish they could a used the same music that they had built from King Kong Vs. Godzilla, and that was how it would be used for the rest of the Showa era.

Earlier that year Toho released Mothra Vs. Godzilla, which is one of my favorite films in the long running series of giant monster movies. Ghidorah, the Three Headed Monster is an interesting follow up. Not only was it a rushed film considering that Mothra Vs. Godzilla played during spring time of the same year, but it\'s the first monster movie to feature Godzilla as a good guy. From the start Godzilla was seen as a notorious monster who scared the entire population of Tokyo. He\'s stomped through cities battling other giant monsters that got in his way. Godzilla was finally defeated by the peaceful Mothra in the fourth installment of the series. Luckily, Godzilla\'s reign of terror didn\'t stop there. In this film, Ghidorah, Godzilla teams up with other monsters to defend planet earth from a terrible extraterrestrial threat. I could go on and on about this movie, because there\'s just so much t say. But I\'ll try to make this review short and simple.I have a feeling that it\'s going to get a little long. The movie takes place shortly after the events in Mothra Vs. Godzilla. After an assassination attempt, a princess from Selgina (a small Himalayan country) becomes possessed by the spirit of a Venusian and escapes a plane just as it explodes. As this happens a meteorite falls from the sky and lands on earth. Little do the people of earth know, inside of the meteorite is King Ghidorah, the monster responsible for planet Venus\' destruction. After the meteor shower, Godzilla and Rodan emerge from hibernation and not only attack Japan, but each other. The battle rages on while the two wreck cities and try to destroy one another. Meanwhile, the media becomes fascinated with the woman who claims that she\'s a profit from Venus. She warns the people that the planet is doomed and that it will be destroyed. This catches the attention of both the media and the mob that\'s planning to kill the princess from Selgina.Later, the space monster known as Ghidorah awakes from its slumber and flies on to destroy everything in its path. When there seems to be no hope, the twin priestesses from Infant island decide to ask Mothra for help. That\'s when Mothra and the tiny twins attempt to convince Godzilla and Rodan to stop their fighting and focus on the new threat, Ghidorah. It\'s important for me to see a good story. You can have the best action and special effects in the world, but if the story isn\'t good, then the movie isn\'t good either. Luckily, I found the story in Ghidorah to be quite amazing. As I mentioned earlier, Ghidorah is one of the last Godzilla movies to be tampered with. Previously some of the earlier Godzilla films were cut to reduce the violence among other things. The American release of Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster runs in at 84 minutes. For the US release scenes that didn\'t really drive the story were taken out, as well as the scenes that carried humor.Luckily the cuts aren\'t all that bad, in way it\'s good because in the American version of the movie you actually get to see the monster Ghidorah earlier. Plus some of the cuts were to fix a continuity error. So the American cut isn\'t bad at all; In fact a lot of Godzilla fans prefer the American cut over the original Japanese version of Ghidorah. This film is very popular amongst fans and critics. Ghidorah is one of the first monster movies to feature the actual monsters solving human problems. Ghidorah carries a James Bond-style that sets up the mood with the film\'s characters. It\'s also the first time we get to see Godzilla as a hero instead of a ruthless monster. Godzilla took on the heroic persona he would wear for the remainder of the series. Ghidorah is also the first Godzilla film to not feature military weapons such as tanks and jets (very interesting). Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster is the first movie to feature Rodan, the flying monster who appeared in his own film in 1956.This movie was also the first to feature the space monster Ghidorah, who would later be Godzilla\'s most frequently recurring opponent. Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster is one of the better films in the Godzilla series. Not only is it a great story, but it\'s remarkably entertaining. The action is great, the acting is good and the ending is definitely pleasing. The bonus features on this DVD are a little slim compared to the other Toho Collection DVDs. It features the usual trailers and still photos, but the best part of the DVD is the audio commentary by David Kalat, author of \'A Critical History and Filmography of Toho\'s Godzilla Series\'. Kalat provides excellent commentary by giving you a history lesson on not only the film, but on the folks behind Toho studios. You\'ll feel a lot smarter after listening to the commentary on the American version of the movie. All in all this is a great watch. If you\'re looking to build up on your Godzilla collection then you have to buy this DVD. Now all we have to do is wait for Toho to release a remastered version of Rodan.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Godzilla\'s most frequently recurring opponent", "unixReviewTime": 1183852800, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2007"}\n',

It starts out (After the credits) on top of a building with a bunch of people looking for flying saucers. (These people NEED to get a life). One of the stars in the movie, a reporter, is blamed for the saucerpeople not coming, and a proffessor says \\"I can\'t help but think that terrible things are about to happen.\\" DUH. After that intillectual thought, a woman screams that she saw a UFO, but turns out only to be a meteorite. And then the scene switches to the star of the movie, a policeman talking to a reporter about Enciphilitis breaking out because of the heat wave that that\'s going on in January. The reporter looks out into the sky and sees the meteorite that will give Earth a few problems. Stay tuned for more details. The reporter leaves and the dude\'s boss comes in and tells the guy to guard a european princess, Salina Salno, who is being sent to Japan because of an assination plot to kill her. Then the scenes switches to the Princess being hypnotised by an alien in a flying saucer to get off the plane, and the plane blows, up and a proffessor goes to find the meteorite, that fell, and will later find out that it holds Ghidrah. Later, the policeman finds the princess ands she\'s a martian from Venus. While this is happening,  the assasinators are sent to kill the princess, this goes on for a while so I won\'t go to deep into it, and while THIS is happening, Rodan and Godzilla appear and start wrecking the place. And Ghidrah hatches from the meteorite and starts doing the same as Godzilla. The fairies from Godzilla x Mothra come in and call Mothra, (one of the babies died) and she finds Godzilla and Rodan fighting each other, shoots them with her silk and tries to convince them to fight against Ghidrah. They don\'t want to, so Mothra goes and fights Ghidrah herself, and Godzilla appears as well as Rodan and the three start attacking Ghidrah together. Meanwhile The princess\'s memory has restored itself and the assasinators have been killed. Meanwhile, Ghidrah is being wrapped up in silk and Godzilla tosses him of the hill, and Ghidrah flies away, humiliated.

My only criticism is that the commentary was not done by Ed Godziszewski and or Steve Ryfle as it was on some of the other releases. While their commentary was thoughtful, selective and well-paced, the commentary on this disc, presented by David Kalat, is done in an unceasing and hurried manner with a highly affected voice that seems to be trying to squeeze everything he\'s ever learned about Godzilla film history into just 85 minutes. It\'s irritating and over-the-top manner proves that even for avid Godzilla film buffs it\'s possible to try and present too much information all at once. There is good information in there, but it\'s surrounded by breathless clutter that I at least found to be highly irritating. Good effort, but poor delivery.However, Ghidrah (aka Ghidorah) is still one of the coolest monsters in film history and the film is enjoyable, both versions.

The novel won the Crime Writers Association Award for Best First Novel and also the John Creasey Award for Best Debut in 1992. The TV adaptation is a co-production between the BBC and WGBH Boston in association with Showcase Canada. This TV adaptation was screened back in 1996 and is finally available on DVD here in the United States.The story reminded me a little of The Midsomer Murders crime series but with darker, more menacing undertones. The story begins with the discovery of a badly decomposed corpse in a desolate and forgotten ice house. The ice house is part of the grounds of a large estate called Streech Grange, owned by Phoebe Maybury (Penny Downie). Ten years earlier, Phoebe\'s despised husband David had gone missing and Phoebe was the prime suspect in the case. The police at the time suspected Phoebe of murdering her husband and had even dug up the grounds in the hope of finding David\'s remains but to no avail.Now that a corpse has turned up, the question is - who is the dead person? Is it David, and if so, did Phoebe kill him? Or is the victim someone else? Enter Chief Inspector George Walsh (Corin Redgrave) and his DS, Andy McLoughlin (a younger Daniel Craig). DCI Walsh has an axe to grind with Phoebe, long suspecting her of covering up her husband\'s murder and is out to prove her guilt. DS McLoughlin on the other hand, goes through the motions as he deals with the collapse of his own personal life.Soon enough though, McLoughlin gets deeply entrenched in the case as he finds there\'s much more going on under the surface. Phoebe now lives at the Grange with two other lady friends, Diana Goode (Frances Barber) and Anne Cattrell (Kitty Aldridge) and there\'s allusions to the ladies\' sexuality, in terms of their proclivity for the female sex. As the investigation goes deeper, it becomes obvious that the three women are concealing something, but what exactly? Even Phoebe\'s two children, Jane and Jonathan who have been away, appear to be hiding something as are the servants.The plot is slow to develop but this is a character-driven drama and every dialogue appears to be important. The interactions between Andy McLoughlin and Anne are especially interesting to watch as it soon becomes evident that McLoughlin and Anne are drawn to each other, even as both realize the risks involved. Daniel Craig is compelling in his role and proves even then that he can be a great character actor. The rest of the ensemble cast also does a great job.This is a story of secrets, romance, the power of gossip to destroy and corrupt, and of revenge most deadly. Those seeking fast and cheap thrills will not find anything to entertain here, but those who enjoy well-developed characters and a tightly woven plot will find themselves engaged.

Marold\\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "`Take the Money and Run\' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist\'s series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall\', his seventh film as writer/director/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death\' and `Bananas\' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam\' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run\' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.Even this very first movie has many of Allen\'s trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen\'s female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas\' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\' appears in a very small role.Two other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character\'s parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall\' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors\' plus several other films.Another typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig\'.One thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can\'t recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote\' or `Candide\', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.Allen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists\' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry\'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.Some movies have compared Allen\'s work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields\' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can\'t hold a candle to Fields\' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.My primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen\'s films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny\' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First triple threat from the Woodman.

The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn\'t travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (\\"it is if you\'re doing it right\\", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say \\"abt natural\\" or \\"I have a gub\\" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.It is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil\'s eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.For those who haven\'t seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That\'s Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.

Even early on in his film career, Woody Allen shows genius and promise to grow much, much further than most artists ever go. The film\'s plot moves along at a good pace and the acting increases the quality of the movie--and the jokes.The film, as you may well know, is a spoof of documentaries called a \\"mockumentary.\\" The film purports to show the life and times of a petty criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). We see him being bullied by his childhood peers on the streets and his failure at playing the cello signals his failure to become a successful criminal.The film is essentially one gag after another in rapid fire. We see Virgil fail at bank robbery after bank robbery; perhaps the funniest is when Virgil and his buddies try to rob a bank when another gang wants to rob the same bank on the same day. We also see Virgil fall in love with beautiful Louise (Janet Margolin). Janet plays Louise with a great deal of realism and her matter-of fact attitude toward Virgil\'s bank robbing is comical as well.In order to make Take The Money And Run feel even more like a documentary, we get \\"interviews\\" with Virgil\'s parents (who wear Groucho Marx glasses to disguise themselves) and teachers and acquaintances who knew Virgil. The acting is excellent.The DVD doesn\'t offer too many extras but the movie is so well done that I will give this a five star rating anyway.Take The Money And Run is sure to give you a laugh--in fact, you\'ll be laughing all the way.

Marold\\"", "helpful": [6, 10], "reviewText": "`The Last Valley\', written, produced, and directed by novelist, James Clavell was, in my mind, a viable candidate for being an underappreciated gem of a movie. Before I bought the DVD, I had seen the movie but once on commercial TV in the 1970\'s and the memory of the movie has stayed with me ever since. The most distinctive aspect of the story is that it deals with an historical period that is almost totally unknown to most Americans who are neither professional historians nor history buffs. Even many events in the history of ancient Greece and Rome are probably better known to many than the story of the 30 years war which by some accounts could be counted as a `world war\', running from 1618 through 1648 and creating, in the process, some of the most memorable figures of modern European history such as the French king Louis XIV (the Sun king), Cardinal Richilieu, Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, and general Wallenstein, the subject of a Schiller dramatic trilogy in the 19th century. As told by a brief introductory blurb at the beginning of the movie, this war began as a religious war between Protestant and Catholic, but devolved into a purely political struggle between France, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire, and the larger German states such as Bavaria. This was so destructive that some history books I have read have said that Germany did not recover from the effects until its unification by Bismarck in the 19th century.In it\'s broadest terms, the outline of the plot is very similar to other movies such as `The Magnificent Seven / The Seven Samurai\' and `The Thirteenth Warrior\' where a band of trained soldiers comes to the aid of a village. Since these three movies are so good, one tends to set high expectations for `The Last Valley\' with a similar plot. The fact that there are some differences in setting are irrelevant to the quality of the movie. In `The Last Valley\', the soldiers are not invited or contracted to come into the village. This company of about thirty mercenaries, lead by captain Michael Caine stumble upon this isolated, hidden village in a remote valley somewhere near the headwaters of the Rhine in southern Germany where the winter snows blocks the passes into the village for half the year.The company is foraging for food as an advance or detachment from a larger army that may or may not be nearby. Expectations on what the mercenaries will do to the village are set by the PG rated violence seen behind as the movie opens as other villagers are robbed, raped, and killed out of hand, if they have not already fallen victim to the plague. By coincidence, the village is also found at the same time by a wandering scholar, Vogel, played by Omar Sharif, who ends up being the mediator between the captain and the town leader, Gruber. In the course of just a few minutes, Vogel convinces the captain to `move in\' on the valley rather than carrying off all its goods. The speed with which the captain agrees to this is a sign of how week was the allegiance of soldiers to the causes for which they fought. In this war, it was much more profitable, and probably even a bit safer to be a soldier than to be a farmer. The captain and his loyal lieutenants summarily kill the very few members of this company who object. I was just slightly annoyed at this as one of those killed off after about 3 minutes on the screen is a mercenary played by Brian Blessed who was featured as Caesar Augustus in the PBS series `I, Claudius\'.While the southern German village was naturally Catholic, the band of mercenaries was a gemish of Catholics and Protestants and only a few of the Protestant soldiers had strong feelings about the existence of the Catholic church and a minority of soldiers showed Catholic leanings when the captain moves a shrine from the path leading to the village.All of this setup is the platform upon which Clavell presents his primary idea that this war has killed God, primarily at the especially bloody (historically accurate) battle of Magdeburg that occurred ten years before the time of the movie. The captain states that Magdeburg was razed in retaliation to the siege of some other city which was attacked to pay for the distruction of some other town which was destroyed to avenge the sack of some village and on and on and on, and God has done nothing to stop it. This speech is the linchpin of the whole movie, as it resonates all the way back to Greek tragedy where a vendetta between two families is only stopped by judges who claim the authority of the gods, so their decision cannot be avenged by further violence. All this is boiled down to the simple quote from the Bible of `Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord\'. But at Magdeburg, the Lord seems to have disappeared from its role in human life.All this is great stuff and everything connected to this worldview in the movie makes some sense. The only problem is that moviemaker Clavell does not give us much on which to develop an interest in whether these characters live or die. A simple comparison between our feelings for these villagers and the Mexican peasants in `The Magnificent Seven\' shows us that the characters in `The Last Valley\' have about as little soul as the missing God whose lack of attention has created these scenes of distruction straight out of a painting by Breughel. The only interest is in the chess game of force and allegiances played out between the captain, Vogel, Gruber, and the captain\'s troops.The DVD has no extras to speak of. Unlike `The 13th Warrior\', I think this movie deserves the obscurity into which it has fallen.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lost & great the first time around, but pales after the 2nd", "unixReviewTime": 1112745600, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2005"}\n',

It puts its characters through all the tribulations of Europe in the Thirty Years\' War; it isn\'t light entertainment. But as cinematic history it\'s important: James Clavell in a rare role as director; Michael Caine and Omar Sharif in brilliant performances; early roles by young actors like Brian Blessed.And it may seem overwrought. The director took at least some visual motifs from Breughel and other dark artists of the period. Others have told me this last valley seemed almost a surreal vision of Alpine heaven, an unrealistic \\"Sound of Music\\" setting. Perhaps that was the point, that this village would represent a vision, a haven from the hellpit that Europe had become by 1640. It\'s almost a fantasy, a fever dream. In truth there may have been no such haven in that war; probably every village, town and city in Germany or Bohemia were sacked at least once, and the population of Germany fell by anywhere from a fifth to a third.Perhaps Omar Sharif\'s character is a metaphor, as is the Captain -- as much as the carnival fool and the knight in \\"Seventh Seal\\", although the Sharif and Caine characters are far more haunted. (Indeed, the icy Captain is still guilt-ridden merely for having been present at the sack of Magdeburg, and the burning of the city\'s people). Hoffman, the superstitious peasant (played, competently enough, by Arthur O\'Connell) and Gruber as the cagey, cunning village chief, are also parable characters of all the people of this village and those times.

Which is a great pity, because this almost completely forgotten Shangri-La tale set during the Thirty Years War, the last of the great European religious wars, deserves to be much better known despite the potentially disastrous miscasting of the two leads. Omar Sharif is no more anyone\'s ideal casting as a 17th Century German schoolteacher trying to talk his way out of a premature death than Michael Caine is anyone\'s idea of a German mercenary captain, yet despite a few moments unease at Caine\'s aksent (a dry run for the one he used in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), within moments you realise that against all odds both actors are delivering surprisingly sincere and well-judged performances.From the main title animation that sees a cross split into two sword-wielding rival soldiers, it\'s not always a pretty picture, making few bones about the dirt, ugliness and squalor of the times, with Sharif\'s schoolteacher wandering from village massacre to plague pits before literally stumbling upon an unspoilt and unlooted valley. Unfortunately he stumbles across it at the same time as Caine\'s [...]-ugly ragtag band of mercenaries, cutthroats, murderers, rapists, Papists, Protestants and atheists pillaging the countryside for supplies. Convincing them to spend the Winter there in comfort rather than see the valley\'s food gone in days if they share it among their army, he finds himself cast as an uneasy go-between trying to improvise and keep the fragile peace between the mercenaries and the villagers. But for all its beauty, the valley is no idyllic haven but just as riven with suspicion, prejudice and duplicity as the outside world as the two sides engage in a constant subtle power struggle: ultimately it is not the valley that is destroyed by the soldiers but the soldiers who are destroyed by the valley as they are reminded of the people they almost were. Even Sharif\'s intermediary has more to fear from the villagers than the soldiers.A huge box-office flop in 1970 (in the States it quickly ended up as a second feature), it\'s far from a conventional epic. There are only a couple of action scenes, and only one of them qualifies as spectacular, while its characters are not major figures but human driftwood caught up in the wake of greater events and gradually rejecting the accepted religious and moral beliefs of their time. Instead of a triumphant tone, it\'s a melancholy picture about people trying to survive in the worst of all possible worlds, where moments of beauty are merely reminders of how much has been lost in the past rather than what could be in the future. John Barry\'s superb score, possibly his best ever, reflects this beautifully, alternating the savagery he displayed in his earlier The Lion in Winter with an incredibly beautiful theme for the valley. It\'s not a film for all tastes, but there\'s a melancholy magic there willing to look for it.It\'s a shame that none of the extras-free DVD versions available do justice to the 65mm photography (though the sadly extras-free Region 1 MGM and Anchor Bay releases are at least widescreen, unlike the clumsily cropped UK release), but it\'s still a film that deserves to be sought out in its original widescreen ratio.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A forgotten epic well worth remembering", "unixReviewTime": 1188777600, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2007"}\n',

Bernabo", "helpful": [48, 50], "reviewText": "You have to give Marlo Thomas, daughter of television legend Danny Thomas (\\"Make Room for Daddy\\"), for starting a definite trend in situation comedies with \\"That Girl,\\" which aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971; a lot of us remember the show from when ABC showed reruns during the day from 1969 to 1972).  In the wake of \\"That Girl\\" came other comedies about Independent Women such as \\"The Doris Day Show,\\" \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\\" and \\"Rhoda.\\"  Marlo Thomas played Ann Marie, a perky young actress who left the home of her father (Lew Parker) and mother (Rosemary DeCamp) in Brewster, New York, to make it on her own in New York City.  Since all she could find where roles in television commercials and small parts in plays here and there, she had to support herself with a lot of odd jobs around town.  This provided ample opportunity for new venues for comic encounters between new characters and \\"That Girl.\\"  Along for the ride was Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), a junior executive at \\"Newsview\\" magazine who spent all five seasons trying to get \\"That Girl\\" down the aisle.This first DVD gives us nine choice episodes from the show\'s entire run:(1) The pilot episode \\"Don\'t Just Do Something, Stand There\\" (September 8, 1966) begins our saga as Ann is working as a candy clerk and meets Donald.  When he sees her again she is doing a perfume commercial where she gets kidnapped by two robbers.  Donald thinks this is real and comes to her rescue with predictable results.(2) \\"Anatomy of a Blunder\\" (Episode 5, October 6, 1966), has Ann bringing Donald home to meet her parents but making the mistake of stopping for a nice little picnic along the way.(3) \\"Counter Proposal\\" (Episode 113, Season premier for Season 5, September 25, 1970) completes the informal \\"Donald Trilogy\\" that opens this disc with the moment when Donald finally asks Ann to marry him.  That is the good news; the bad news is that his co-worker Bob Howard (Ronnie Schell) talks Donald into buying an engagement ring second hand from Mr. Franklin (Avery Schreiber).  Note: This is the first episode to feature lyrics for the \\"That Girl\\" theme song.(4) \\"Call of the Wild\\" (Episode 50, January 25, 1968) has Ann insulted when she is hired to be the Creamy Soap Girl because the producer (Jesse White) sees her as having the sort of face that will not make housewives jealous.  Consequently, Ann is convinced she has no sex appeal, and that is not something for \\"That Girl\\" to take without a fight.(5) \\"Nobody Here But Us Chickens\\" (Episode 90, October 9, 1969) continues the bad commercial gigs as Ann is hired by Major Culpepper (Slim Pickens) to be the Dancing Chicken for his friend chicken chain.  When the Major tries to hit on her in his car, Ann hits the road (guess how she is dressed).(6) \\"The Snow Must Go On\\" (Episode 93, October 30, 1969) finds Ann and Donald stuck with her parents at Kennedy Airport during a blizzard.  Of course Ann has a Broadway audition to go to and nothing short of complete and total disaster will stop her.(7) \\"This Little Piggy Had a Ball\\" (Episode 28, March 23, 1967),has Ann enduring one the peculiar tribulations of sit com stars, getting something stuck in something at the wrong time.  Just cross Lucy\'s bowling ball with Laura Petrie\'s toe, and you get the idea.  Rob Reiner plays Carl and Teri Garr is Estelle in this episode.(8) \\"Pass the Potatoes, Ethel Merman\\" (Episode 31, season premier for 2nd season, September 7,1 967) has the legendary Broadway star herself picking Ann for a walk on role in \\"Gypsy.\\"  You know this sounded like a good idea at the time.  Merman would return later that season and become \\"The Other Woman\\" for Ann\'s father.(9) \\"Those Friars\\" (Episode 127, January 8, 1971) features not only Danny Thomas but also \\"Mr. Television\\" himself, Milton Berle as guest stars.  Strangely enough, the two television legends play themselves.  It seems that Ann\'s uncle, an old vaudevillian has died, and the two pop out to try and buy the old trunk left to her in Uncle Harry\'s will.I am not particularly enamored of the \\"That Girl\\" television series and its ability to end each and every teaser with the title phrase, but whoever selected these nine episodes did a pretty good job.  There is no special \\"wedding\\" episode of the series because Donald only got as far as a stage party (plus Thomas did not want to send the wrong message to young women by making that the end of the series), but these episodes are certainly representative of what this show was about.  You also have an impressive set of guest stars and it was a nice touch saving daddy for the last one.  Yes, your favorite might not be included in these nine episodes--mine was \\"I Ain\'t Got Nobody,\\" when Ann\'s face was put on someone else\'s body in the centerfold of \\"Playpen\\" magazine--but there is not a bad episode in this bunch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Marlo Thomas as \\"That Girl\\":  Think Women\'s Lib Lite", "unixReviewTime": 1051747200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2003"}\n',

The source of this program\'s appeal is of course Marlo Thomas, in the role that defined her acting career. Thomas as the perky Ann Marie, and Ted Bessell as the handsome, logical Donald Hollinger made perhaps the perfect sixties TV couple, rivaled in popularity perhaps only by Don Adams and Barbara Feldon of &quot;Get Smart&quot;. Show-stealer Lew Parker is also outstanding as Ann\'s crusty dad, a restaurant owner with a machine gun style of delivering dialog, who thinks that every guy who dates his daughter is just a &quot;bum&quot;.  These episodes are, to use an overused term, &quot;classic TV&quot;, and should not be missed by any true aficionado of 60\'s television.  Hopefully this is the first of many releases for this wonderful program, which still seems fresh after 35 years.This first collection of episodes is an attempt at capturing an overview of the series. While this effort is for the most part successful, it could have been arranged better. Anchor Bay should be applauded for including nine episodes of &quot;That Girl&quot; on this first release. Total runtime is a whopping 225 minutes. Compare that to Star Trek\'s standard two episodes per DVD. Instead of being arranged in chronological order, the episodes are subdivided into three thematic groups, which may not have been the best idea.The series first aired in 1966, and ended in 1971. During that time, the characters, particularly Ann and Donald undergo significant changes in appearance and wardrobe. There is no mistaking the Ann of 1966 with the Ann of 1971. By not following chronological order, we see the characters changing appearance significantly between some episodes, disrupting continuity. Also, two consecutive episodes feature instances of Ann\'s employer making a pass at her. Once again, a little more thought could have gone into how the episodes were arranged. These are minor quibbles, but as a result, the overall flow of the episodes is somewhat uneven, and doesn\'t feel quite right. For any future releases, I suggest that the episodes be arranged closer to chronological order.The fact that there are no bonus materials is also a major disappointment, especially as this is the first collection of episodes to be released. The printed booklet is a good start, but this series deserves much more. A series retrospective would have been nice. An interview with Ms. Thomas, the only member of the principal cast who is still with us, would have been appropriate. Anchor Bay should be aiming to build the audience for the forthcoming releases.  Overall video quality is very good, although focus does suffer at times.Despite these criticisms, &quot;That Girl&quot; is not to be missed.  Take a trip back to a world far removed from today. The signature hairstyle, the music, the bowling ball stuck on the toe, and Ann dancing in a chicken suit, are all waiting for you.

Bala \\"Me Too Can Read\\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it\'s about time (but now I\'m cheesed with the DVD\'s lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can\'t help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won\'t put anything in his comics which his characters couldn\'t do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.Woody thinks that his friend Harry\'s job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he\'s merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who\'s mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.So, if you\'re a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn\'t daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn\'t who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he\'s good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it\'s certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a \\"foolish dreamer who draws comic books\\" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody\'s amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you\'re sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley\'s novelThe Game of X, which I haven\'t read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody\'s intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where\'s the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia\'s itinerary simply by reading Woody\'s comic books.When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn\'t really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I\'m glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we\'d seen something of Woody\'s other creations. I can\'t help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl.

About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who\'s best friend Harry (Michael J Fox\'s father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia\'s boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn\'t always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features.

And, while the yellow team is interested in fair play and following directions, Harold\'s only interest is in winning and going to any extremes to do it.Interestingly enough, this movie was produced at a pivotal moment in American pop culture.  At the start of the game, we witness the red team inhabiting a discoteque, the likes of which had already begun to go out of fashion.  Also of note was the use of the Pabst Brewery as a clue location; Pabst Blue Ribbon bear is now produced by the Miller corporation.  Another clue location is in an arcade referred to as Pinball City and, as the name would suggest, populated largely by pinball tables.  One of few videogames in the place is an actual game called StarFire. This game pointedly draws on the first StarWars film from 1977.  In one year\'s time, there\'d be more videogames than anything in most arcades and more money going towards playing them than towards buying music.In addition, the Walt Disney company and Buena Vista Entertainment made a supposedly calculated move when the movie was packaged, not including the Disney logo, for fear that a PG-rated movie would tarnish their reputation.  However, this writer is mildly convinced that the inclusion of Disney packaging might\'ve aided this film\'s popularity on the strength of notoriety.  Six years later, we were given the Disney film flight of the Navigator, and their adult divison, Touchstone Pictures was fully active, producing pictures of its own.The leading man, (Naughton) is best known for his role in the 1981 comedic horror flick, An American Werewolf in London.  It is commonly believed that Naughton was chosen by director John Landis for this role on the heals of his spokesmanship for Dr. Pepper.  However, as mentioned before, Naughton\'s advocary is played by Stephen Furst.  Furst is best known for his portrayal of Kent \'Flounder\' Dorfman in the Landis film Animal House.  This writer is convinced that Landis opted to follow Stephen Furst\'s caeer path.  This would ultimately lead to a screening of Midnight Madness, in which case David Naughton would become clearly visible.  The likelihood that John Landis would recruit Naughton American Werewolf on the heels of this film is at least as likely as on the heels of a soft-drink commercial.(Of corse, it doesn\'t hurt that one of the jocks is portrayed by Dirk Blocker, whose legendary father Dan Blocker was internationally known for portraying Eric \\"Hoss\\" Cartwright on Bonanza.  Dirk also made a cameo appearance during Season 1 of Little House on the Prairie.  And, his character definiely adds surrealistic levity to the film\'s main plot.

The first was the science fiction film \\"The Black Hole,\\" a movie best left moldering on video store shelves. \\"Midnight Madness\\" will never fade away since HBO, in its infinite wisdom, played the film on a perpetual loop from roughly 1982 to 1986. I must have watched this movie a thousand times during that period, and so did a million other people from the looks of it. Strangely, I completely forgot about the film for seventeen years, only remembering it when I stumbled over reviews for the picture on some website. Unfortunately, at the time it had not come out on DVD, so I had to wait until Disney saw fit to release it. Rewatching any film after a nearly two-decade interregnum is often a painful experience. In the case of \\"Midnight Madness,\\" the sheer exuberance of the actors\' performances and the wild hilarity of the plot completely overshadow spots of bad acting and general cheesiness. Never the sort of film that would win any awards-except for one of those raspberry trophies, perhaps-the picture still entertains. HBO ought add this to the queue again.\\"Midnight Madness\\" is a scavenger hunt film in the vein of \\"Scavenger Hunt,\\" \\"It\'s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,\\" and \\"Million Dollar Mystery.\\" Some guy named Leon (Alan Solomon) manages to convince a group of his fellow college students to take part in his latest entertainment, a scavenger hunt called \\"The Game.\\" Five groups of kids will take part; each identified by a specific color, e.g. white, red, yellow, green, and blue. Of course, each group represents a clique on campus. The white team consists of the geeks, led by the always awesome Eddie Deezen in the role of Wesley. The yellow team, better known as the obligatory \\"good guys,\\" consists of Adam (David Naughton), Laura (Debra Clinger), and eventually Adam\'s little brother Scott (Michael J. Fox). Jocks constitute the green team, lead by Lavitas (Brad Wilkin) and composed of athletes with monikers like Armpit (Curt Ayers). The blue team is the villain of the film, a group of offbeat nuts like Melio (Andy Tennant) and Barf (Brian Frishman) led by the egomaniacal Harold (Stephen Furst). Finally, the red team is the girl team, with the most notable contestants here being two giggly, overweight twins named Lulu and Peggy (Carol Gwynn and Betsy Lynn Thompson respectively). Each group has its own quirky attributes, and all of them despise the other teams. Harold, for instance, can\'t stand Adam because Harold\'s father thinks Adam is the archetypical \\"perfect\\" son. When he looks at his own boy, his attitude is summed up in one word: yech.As the game progresses, we see the teams roaming the city while Leon runs the show from his grungy apartment. Clues lead the teams to an observatory, a beer factory, a piano shop, a burger joint, and several other places. Cheating, tricks, and outright hostility mark every leg of the game. Harold, who must win no matter what the cost if he is to retain even a shred of his father\'s affections, cheats from the get go with a fancy computer that instantly decodes Leon\'s clues. Problems often threaten to derail the teams, such as a flat tire for the yellows, Peggy and Lulu running off to dance at a disco, and melting marshmallows. Then there are the clues, cryptic messages that mystify the contestants. They more often find the clues through dumb luck than any sort of skill. \\"Look between the two melons,\\" for example, would not offer up an instant answer no matter what the circumstances-unless you\'re a guy, perhaps. All of the midnight madness takes place firmly within the confines of late \'70\'s and early \'80\'s pop culture. The hyper cheesy disco tune at the beginning, a clue in a video game, and two gals on roller skates wearing tube tops are a good indication that \\"Midnight Madness\\" could not have been made at any other time.The acting is often painful to watch. I can\'t remember a time I saw facial expressions so overdone. Naughton and Clinger are the worst performers in the film, but even then it\'s all done in such an innocent way that you tend to forgive their ridiculous overemoting. On the other hand, other actors do a great job. Andy Tennant\'s Melio is a real hoot, as is Brian Frishman in the iconic role of Barf. Eddie Deezen does dork better than anyone on the planet and he\'s at the top of his game in this film. Fortunately, the script provides these thespians with the best lines and scenes in cornball celluloid history. \\"Fagabeefe. Hey Melio, Fagabeefe!\\" is a line that should ring from the highest buildings in the land. My absolute favorite scene involves Barf playing that keyboard (Chopsticks, I think?), soon joined by Melio, to the great consternation of Harold. Priceless, just priceless. I don\'t think I even need to mention the whipsaw fast pace of the movie since any picture about a scavenger hunt will always move at lightning speed.I rented \\"Midnight Madness\\" when I watched it recently, but I really need to buy a copy. My sister, I suspect, doesn\'t know this movie is out on DVD and would simply love to see it again. Sadly, the disc contains no extras. You can\'t tell me they couldn\'t get some of these guys together to do a commentary, especially Michael J. Fox if for no other reason than this was his first film role. Too, the transfer is fullscreen instead of glorious widescreen. Still, I\'m not complaining.

Summers \\"Gamekrazy\\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Any time I sit down to watch this movie, I am always reminded of the first time that I saw it.  It was 1986, I was in the Army, stationed at Fort Devens during my AIT, and not having a television of my own, I was in the communal television room watching HBO with some of the other guys.  We were sitting around watching television that day when Midnight Madness came on, and from the very beginning, I was hooked.  As I said, at that time I didn\'t have a television or a vcr of my own, but still, I went out and bought a blank tape, and the next time Midnight Madness was on, I recorded myself a copy on the vcr in the communal room until I did get my own.  I still have that copy of the movie, and now I\'m the proud owner of my own copy of it on dvd.  For me, just hearing the opening strands of the Midnight Madness song at the beginning of the movie, and seeing the two cute girls rollerskating are enough to bring a smile to my face.  I think back to that first time that I saw the movie, and I have to sit down and watch it all over again.  The basic premise of the movie is this: the two girls you see at the beginning of the movie are delivering five invitations inviting five decidedly different people to compete in a game, called \\"the greal allnighter\\".  Once the five captains have accepted the invitation and formed teams, they scour the city, solving clues, leading them from one location to the next, guiding them towards a final goal, whichever team arriving there first being the winner.  Of course there are many subplots involved in this: backstabbing amongst the teams, romance brewing, family strife, and other things.Watching the five teams trying to figure out the clues is all a good part of the fun, and the main charm behind the movie, as well as the interaction among the individual members of the teams, and the teams themselves.  Adam\'s team is the most clean cut of them all, being the only team who doesn\'t really cheat, and the one that I root for, but Harold\'s team is the most entertaining.  Harold, played by Stephen Furst, is a fat slob whose father bullies him into playing the game because he\'s found out that Adam is playing it.  Harold\'s team consists of a gang of misfits, who cheat at every turn, and cause Adam\'s team all kinds of problems, but it\'s hilarious to see it all played out.Wesley, played by the original ubernerd Eddie Deezen, leads one of the other teams, and it\'s good fun to see his squad of nerds riding around on their mopeds, hamming it up.  The last two teams, the jock team, led by Lavitas, and the all girl team, lead by Donna, are probably the least interesting of all of them, but three teams really wouldn\'t have been enough, so they serve their purpose.I\'m not sure why I really like this movie so much, it\'s not all that original, but still, it never fails to bring a smile to my face, and after all, what more is a movie supposed to do but entertain us.  From the music, through the clothing, to the tour of the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer plant, I just love everything about this movie.  It was only ever the second movie I had come across that I could watch over a dozen times without getting bored of seeing it.  So, I highly recommend this movie, and if you haven\'t seen it yet, why not?  Hurry out and rent or buy this movie for yourself, you won\'t regret it.FYI, just in case you happened to be wondering what the first move was that I was able to watch over a dozen times without getting bored of it, I have just four words for you: \\"Grease\\" is the word.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of my favorite movies", "unixReviewTime": 992304000, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2001"}\n',

However, in terms of sheer, nostalgic fun and late-night silliness, Midnight Madness is a classic--as the numerous, heartfelt reviews here show.The plot is simple:  a mastermind, Leon, stages a Los Angeles-wide scavenger hunt, inviting five captains and their teams to play for everlasting glory.  Heralding in the class-consciousness of later \'80\'s movies, there are the White Team (nerds on mopeds); the Green Team (jocks in Meat Machine convertible); Red Team (sorority gals); Blue Team (outcasts in super-van with computer--TRS-80?); and Yellow Team (the good guys).

Leverton", "helpful": [22, 22], "reviewText": "Disney studios ended its family-friendly filmmaking in 1979 with two films:  \\"Unidentified Flying Oddball\\" and \\"North Avenue Irregulars.\\"  While \\"U.F.O\\" is a silly time-waster, \\"North Avenue Irregulars\\" remains a personal favorite, with an outstanding cast enlivening thin (and let\'s face it, dated) material and delivering loud and frequent laughs.  Feminists will object strongly to the female stereotypes, but most everyone else will ignore the silliness of it all and find much to enjoy in this fast-paced lark.The Rev. Mike Hill (Edward Herrmann) has just taken over as pastor at North Avenue Presbyterian Church, much to the displeasure of Anne Woods (Susan Clark), whose father recently retired as pastor.  The rest of the flock includes daffy housewife Vicki (Barbara Harris), dippy (and apparently wealthy) old maid Claire (Cloris Leachman), ditsy engaged debutante Jane (Karen Valentine) whose fiance Howard is an insufferable mama\'s boy, dotty elderly couple Rose and Delaney Rafferty (Patsy Kelly and Douglas V. Fowley) and apparently the only level-headed member of the congregation, matronly African-American Cleo (Virginia Capers).  In his first decision as pastor, Mike decides to get the confrontation involved in church business by delegating responsibility, so he puts Rose in charge of the \\"church sinking fund.\\"  Unfortunately, his plans backfire when Delaney loses the money in a horse race, so Mike angrily confronts the bookie, Harry the Hat (Alan Hale Jr., the skipper from \\"Gilligan\'s Island\\"), and demands he give the money back, but instead he\'s humiliated and thrown out on the street.  A trip to the police proves fruitless, so he decides to take matters into his own hands by using his televised Sunday morning sermon to blast the city\'s out-of-control organized crime and corrupt officials.  His tirade catches the eye of Treasury agent Marv Fogelberg (Michael Constantine) who enlists Mike to set up a sting operation in order to catch syndicate boss Max Roca (Joseph Campenella).  When he can\'t convince any of the city\'s men to help, he enlists the help of his churchladies, whose pluck he admires. At first Marv resists, then warms to the idea, after all, he says, \\"Who would suspect a bunch of ding-a-ling dames?\\"What follows is a series of laugh-out-loud confrontations between the bumbling churchladies (including Delaney in drag) and the frazzled crooks, and at least one jarring act of violence that snaps Anne out of her daze and angers her enough to join the gang.  And with the exception of that one act, everything is played for silly laughs and the crooks are so hapless even when Vicki brings her kids along on a stakeout and car chase noone ever seems to be in real danger.  What makes everything work so well is the cast, who all seem to be having a great time.  There isn\'t a weak link among the performers, but there are standouts, especially Herrmann, who plays a refreshing change-of-pace, a religious authority figure who isn\'t crazy, judgmental or a member of the moral right, so much as a nice and decent guy and concerned citizen doing what he thinks is right; Clark, who simply is incapable of giving a bad performance, and Harris, who seems to be having a blast playing an atypical (for her) brain-dead loon.  Capers (who sadly passed away a couple of months ago) also makes a strong impression and has one hilarious scene where she chases a crook while pushing a baby carriage.  (An additional note on the casting:  look closely at the young girl playing Mike\'s daughter Carmel; she\'s Melora Hardin, who grew up to play the beautiful and sexy woman murdered by President Gene Hackman\'s secret service detail in Clint Eastwood\'s \\"Absolute Power.\\")Other highlights include another of veteran Disney composer Robert F. Brunner\'s bouncy musical scores that really propels the action and will stick in your head for hours (if not days), an above-average animated opening credits sequence, and a very funny last-minute appearance by Ruth Buzzi as a CB-addicted church official.  Unfortunately, once again a \'70\'s Disney film ends with that tired plot contrivance: a car chase/demolition derby that kids will enjoy but adults will find as old and tired as it was when the Keystone Kops did it in the silent movie days.  But up until this point, the film scores a comedic bullseye.One note about Disney\'s DVD presentation:  like most of Disney\'s films of the era, it was filmed in 1:66:1 widescreen format.  However, Disney has cropped the top and bottom of the picture so that it fits on 1:85:1 widescreen TV screens, which seems to be a wide-spread practice with DVD transfers nowadays.  (I\'ve discovered this in Universal and MGM/UA releases as well.)  They get by with this by labeling the DVD as presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen \\"enhanced for widescreen TVs.\\"  So purists beware:  you\'re getting widescreen format but losing the top and bottom of the picture.  I find this annoying but less annoying than fullscreen, since you don\'t get the headache-enducing pan-and-scan effect and there is less important picture information lost on the top and bottom of the screen.  Either way, nobody seems to have caught on to this, so I thought I\'d pass it on.  At least Disney has cleaned up the picture and \\"North Avenue Irregulars\\" looks better on this DVD than the grubby VHS version.  **** (out of *****) for the film, **1/2 for the DVD, which features no extras whatsoever.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\\"Who would suspect a bunch of ding-a-ling dames?\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1092873600, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2004"}\n',

The thing that he does not know is that her husband is a compulsive gambler.  When she tells him that Rafterty has bet the whole $1,206 on a horse race, he goes to stop the wager but is too late.  When he asks for the money back, he is given the door.That night he goes on local television and instead of giving his planned sermon, he goes on a tirade about illegal gambling and the police looking the other way.  This gets the eye of the FBI (Michael Constantine and Steve Franken) and Reverend Hill (Edward Herrmann) is asked about set up a sting operation.The reverend goes to all the men in the congregation but they are unwilling to go up against the mob.  But his crew of church ladies are ready to run the sting.  The crew includes, the professional mom, Vickie (Barbara Harris), the bride to be, Annie (Karen Valentine), the rich perpetual single, Claire (Cloris Leachman), the retiree, Rose (Patsy Kelly) and the wife of a small business owner, Cleo (Virginia Capers).Their first attempts at the sting are miserable flops.  So rather than try to dry up the sources they decide to go after the bank.  The girl try to follow the courier back to home base and after many hilarious attempts they finally find the bank and take on the syndicate in a wild demolition derby.This is not a great film.  It often goes over the top.  But it is just an all out fun film with no gratuitous sex or obscene language!  This has some of the best all out great visual gags including Cloris Leachman becoming a maniac after breaking all her fingernails.Although this film took place back east, it was shot in the San Fernando Valley (Southern California).  Watch during the pursuit scenes one of the street signs says Lankershiem Boulevard, a major street in the valley.This is a highly talented cast including Tony Award winners (Barbara Harris, Virginia Capers and Patsy Kelly), Emmy Award winners (Cloris Leachman, Michael Constantine, Karen Valentine, Susan Clark and Edward Herrmann) and an Oscar winner (Leachman).  And that was before they made this film.This is one of the best of the later Disney family films and will always be a great time.DVD EXTRAS: None", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Last Great Disney Family Film", "unixReviewTime": 1146528000, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2006"}\n',

It has practically all the elements that form other movies of Italian maestro: boarding school for girls, mysterious murderer, dreamy atmosphere, beautiful music (although I thought the soundtrack could do easily without Iron Maiden and Motorhead), hidden rooms and passages in the houses, some unexpected and unthinkable plot lines, like Jennifer Connely\'s character being able to communicate with insects...It\'s difficult, maybe even impossible to explain the beauty of Argento\'s pictures.

Whereas the edited version was a fast-moving collage of half-baked themes which evoked nothing of any significance, PHENOMENA reinstates the crazy-quilt pacing, whereby dream-like passages surrender abruptly to episodes of screaming hysteria, all of which is essential to any appreciation of the film\'s dark ambitions.Romano Albani\'s sumptuous cinematography transforms the breathtaking Swiss locations into a fairy-tale landscape where monstrous eruptions of violence disturb the illusion of tranquility, and Jennifer Connelly drifts through the narrative  in a state of near-hypnotic grace, allowing herself to become ensnared by the machinations of a deformed killer and his/her equally psychotic \'guardian\'. True, the longer version is bogged down at times by lengthy dialogue scenes which hold up the plot, and the involvement of Donald  Pleasence\'s chimp is no less misguided than before (its final act of retribution crosses the line into absurdity), but the set-pieces are magnificently realised, and the final 20 minutes are as hair-raising as  anything in Argento\'s ouevre.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Argento\'s neglected masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 948499200, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2000"}\n',

For that reason, it seems silly to review the movie itself.  It has a typical Argento plot, alternating endless scenes of exposition with scenes of effective tension and lurid violence, all building to a particularly crazy third act.  It also has Argento\'s typically exquisite production values and cinematography, and a typically bizarre/fantastic Goblin score, and Jennifer Connelly acquits herself well for a teenage actor in an Argento movie.  It\'s draggy and not particularly scary, but Argento fans should know what they\'re getting into (and seriously, the ending is absolutely bonkers).As for the Blu-Ray itself: Gorgeous.  This version contains scenes previously cut from the non-Italian release, meaning that they are presented in subtitled Italian on slightly more weathered film, but the overall presentation has an ideal blend of sumptuous color and sharp texture, with appropriate grain throughout.  The sound is nicely mixed and balanced, with much nicer low-end than some of Argento\'s older movies (Italian 70s productions in general are a little tinny-sounding).  The bonus features are interesting, in particular a lengthy making-of featurette where the makeup designer talks about designing the climactic &#34;monster&#34; (his real-life inspiration makes the creature itself much more disturbing).Finally, as always, I feel I should point out that amazon.co.uk sells a region-free Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of Phenomena for around 12GBP, which (even with international shipping and the exchange rate) is much cheaper than buying the Blu-Ray stateside.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Blu-Ray, typically insane movie", "unixReviewTime": 1391731200, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2014"}\n',

If Creepers is a B-Movie, then I\'d say it is a B+ Movie for all that is offers. This movie features Jennifer Connelly of movies such as \\"Dark Water\\" and \\"The House of Sand and Fog.\\" We have seen Donald Pleasant most famously in the \\"Halloween\\" films and so many more. Jennifer is so young in the movie to where it was almost impossible to recognize her, since I had never seen Mrs Connelly when she was young. I think what this actress showcases most in this early film is a presence of mind and timing, all while being on film. Mrs. Connelly does not seem at all intiimidated by her craft nor by her cameras. She seems to be completely in the muse of her character.What I do not see in this film are the lovely eyes of Mrs. Connelly. In her more modern films I have fallen in love with the actrecesses eyes and her often depressed or sullen characters. In films like \\"Dark Water\\" I just wanted to reach out to Mrs Connelly in love, because she seemed so very sad, and so much of this was portrayed through her beautiful and sad eyes. So much for the window to her SOUL. And then too there is Connelly\'s beautiful long hair. In Creepers I could recognize Mrs Jennifer through her long hair and the way she would face the camera and the way she would tilt her head.As for this movie, it delivers in a solid manner. The plot is neither over done nor underdeveloped. I think in fact it is just about a perfect balance. In Creepers Jennifer Connelly plays a character named \\"Jennifer\\". I thought that was kinda interesting. She does go to a Swiss boarding school and in an area where a crazy psychopath is presently prowling the night, and day, killing young women. Early in this film Connelly sleepwalks right into a murder scene, and then off into the night and ultimately into the presence of the Donald Pleasance character, a man who is an entomologist, or someone who studies insects. And yes, Mrs Connelly has an affinity or some sort of telepathic connection to insects. She says she loves insects and that they will not harm her.Anyway, what I liked about the movie was, first the lovely and young Mrs Connelly and then how the movie was your basic psycho drama, and all set to the music of bands like MotorHead, Iron Maiden, Bill Wyman and so many other contemporary rock bands of the time period. I feel the \\"Horror\\" aspect of the film was actually ehanced by the movie soundtrack which often played loud over scenes where we would see action but mostly only hear music.The movie progresses to Mrs Connelly on a highway in a tour bus. She has a fly in a cage, one who can detect human decomposition. When the fly becomes agitated Mrs Connelly stops the bus and departs down a hill to a house. The house is vacant but she soon encounters the owner.Later in the movie a lady at the college buys Connelly a ticket to return home to her father. Mrs Jennifer stays with the college lady until the next day when her bus is scheduled to depart. It is at the home of this lady where Connelly finds out to her dismay that the college lady is one of the two psycho murderers, or is she merely protecting her mutant son??As the movie climaxes Connelly flees to a basement and falls into a pit of decaying HUMAN REMAINS, complete with the complement of MAGGOTS. On a wall by the pit is the local \\"Inspector\\" who is chained to a wall. Enter the psycho lady, who is grabbed as the Inspector frees one arm. The psycho lady is severely beaten in the face as she lies on the wall. Mrs Connelly escapes the pit and flees down a hall only to meet the \\"Mutant Child\\" who then assaults her. Mrs Connelly flees to a motor boat on a lake but does not leave the boat dock before the Mutant Child arrrives. The Mutant stuggles with Connelly in the boat and puntures the fuel tank. A fire ensues and both characters make a watery escape into the lake. A badly burned Mutant grabs Mrs Connelly again but escapes as he surfaces in the flames. Mrs Connelly makes it back onto shore. She walks up the hill and suddenly her father pulls up in his car. It quickly seems that there will be a touching reunion, and there almost was, that was before the psycho lady popped up BEHEADING THE FATHER with a piece of plate metal. So Jennifer summons her beloved INSECTS and the woman is quickly devoured and killed.All in all this was a pretty good piece of Horror. I paid one dollar for this film on VHS. My money was very well spent and I was all in all entertained. Check this movie out. It\'s pretty scary, especially at the end. The Donald Pleasance character has little impact upon this film, and he seems merely there for plot purposes. The CHIMP seems to have been for comededic pleasure and he or she delivered.In this film you have rotting bodies, two beheadings, maggotts, maggott flys, a chimp, sleepwalking, a mutant child killer, the protective psycho mother, telepathically controlled insects, a house with metal shudders that fall turning the house into a prison such as in seen in The House on Haunted Hill. And all of this is set to frequently loud music and some of it is vocals that deeply engrain the horror.Check this movie out.

When the book\'s author visits Italy, the killer makes his presence known by slashing women to death with a straight razor. Eventually the police get involved (if there was a list of all time \'Films With the Worst Cops Ever\', TENEBRE would be high on that list) and the book\'s author even tries to take matters into his own hands. At the film\'s conclusion a twist is revealed that comes off like Stephen King meets Scooby Doo.At the time this movie was released, director Dario Argento was known for his supernatural films like SUSPIRIA and INFERNO, however TENEBRE is a straight-forward whodunit, faceless killer, murder mystery. It\'s a timeless movie that, despite its flaws, is stylish in the way that it\'s shot and presented as an overall film. The film boasts an awesome soundtrack provided by his usual music collaborators, consisting of random members of the band Goblin. The movie\'s theme song is also sampled by the Indie Rock/Electronic band Justice on theirCROSSalbum for the songs \\"Phantom\\" and \\"Phantom, pt. II\\". While the movie is pretty solid, it does have some laughable dialogue and overdubs. The movie was filmed in English but still overdubbed nonetheless. The best line of the movie is when the book\'s author\'s assitant Anne offers a Police Officer some alcohol and then says \\"I\'m sorry you probably don\'t drink on duty\\", to which the cop replies \\"I ONLY drink on duty\\". Wow.Overall, TENEBRE is an awesome movie. It has moments of suspense, moments of creepyness, moments that will sneak up and scare the piss out of you, obligatory nudity, great yet sometimes ridiculous acting, an awesome and gory climax, great music, an overdramatic lesbian lovers spat, cops that drink on duty, ax murders, a young John Saxon (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET)... need I say more?

To my opinion this two movies along with \\"Profondo Rosso\\" (\\"Deep Red\\") are the best giallo films in history of cinema although there are many great flicks and filmmakers who worked in this direction. With all my love and respect towards Lucio Fulci, Luigi Cozzi, Sergio Martino, Umberto Lenzi, Ruggero Deodato and so on, I still think Argento\'s movies are way better than any others.In \\"Tenebrae\\" you still have all the necessary attributes of the genre - pretty girls being murdered, killer in black gloves, a sympathetic detective investigating a case, but the film stands out among all others of this kind. I don\'t even know how to explain it, but Argento knows how to create images that will haunt your memory forever after entering it. Dead girl\'s head hanging over at the staircase, murder on a crowded square, dog persuit, the unforgettable finale - these are the scenes you will hardly forget ever. They will still be in your head after many years, like remains of some blurry dream, and you\'ll be wondering: \\"Did I see it in some of Argento films?\\". And you\'ll definately want to watch it once more.I know all his movies by heart, but I still can\'t understand what it is that makes them so special, how Argento manages to create this miraculous and dreamy atmosphere. Maybe we\'re dealing with some kind of divine intervention here.About edition itself: Anchor Bay release is slightly cut, just a couple of seconds, couple of stabs :) If you really want a totally uncut version try to find either Dutch edition by A-Film (titled \\"Shadows\\"), or French one by TF1 Video, or any existing Japanise version. All others have these few seconds cut. But on the other hand Anchor Bay has some good extras, so you may want to have more than one edition if you are a real fan.

He sets himself apart from other filmmakers by setting himself free upon the world he creates and showing it to us in the greatest possible detail. His camera movements are always purposeful and stunning, and he always adds the right amount of lighting and atmospheric music to make up for the poor post-sync dubbing. (Sometimes watching an Argento movie is to relive the best follies of the Godzilla films as you watch people\'s mouths move totally out of place from the dialogue.)\\"Tenebre\\" is one of those movies that stays under your skin for long after you\'ve watched it. It has a tense plot, decent acting, and a climax of such shocking violence that we\'re left with the image of blood spraying a grotesque mural on a wall burned into our brains. Argento\'s darkest side gets unleashed in this film. His creativity was obviously at the top if its form when he thought of the camera move that scales the entire exterior of a house up to the top floor, moving into a close up on the roofing tiles, and then back out to a medium shot on an intended victim standing in a window. This shot creates a great deal of tension, even with the bad music playing in the background. (The DVD shows a behind the scenes featurette about the creation of this one memorable shot.)The plot of the film is too ridiculously simple to take a long time to explain. In fact, other films have used it since then. \\"Basic Instinct,\\" for example, is about a serial killer who murders her victims in the same fashion as is written in novels by her favorite author. \\"Tenebre\\" came out before \\"Basic Instinct\\", and has almost exactly the same plot, minus the gratuitous sex scenes and lesbianism. I wonder if Ezterhas was an Argento fan. Doesn\'t matter. Argento\'s film buries \\"Basic Instinct\\" with a style Paul Verhoeven can\'t hope to match. It rises above most of Argento\'s other films as a classic of the pulp horror genre.

For his best supernatural thriller, see \\"Suspiria.\\"  For his best giallo, see \\"Tenebrae.\\"I found \\"Tenebrae\\" to be much more enjoyable than \\"Deep Red,\\" the 1975 pic most people consider to be Argento\'s best.  \\"Tenebrae\\" has few of the gaps in pacing evidenced by \\"Deep Red\\"\'s unedited bilingual version, and it also has an arguably more likeable lead--Anthony Franciosa playing Peter Neal, a successful American author on a book tour in Rome, a man who suddenly finds himself at the epicenter of a series of kinky murders committed by a fan apparently obsessed with Neal\'s most recent bestseller (\\"Tenebrae,\\" which means \\"darkness\\" in Italian.)So many faces familiar to Eurohorror pop up here: Daria Nicolodi as Neal\'s assistant who may or may not survive the bloodbath; John Steiner (also in Bava\'s \\"Shock\\" and the infamous \\"Caligula\\") making a bow as a nosy book reviewer; John Saxon as the cynical literary agent; Ania Pieroni, she of the gorgeous eyes and killer body, getting killed for being a promiscuous shoplifter.  These engaging actors are thrown into a film filled with sexual tension, mystery...and murder.  Lots of murder.  The body count here is lower than, say, a \\"Halloween\\" or Jason movie, but the killings themselves are so memorable and done in such an artistic way--such an Argento way--that they instantly make one\'s top ten list.It goes without saying that Argento\'s camera gymnastics are amazing here, including a two-minute louma crane shot covering the entire exterior of a building.  If there are any drawbacks, it\'s that the color is rather washed out; most interiors are white on white, and as one critic once said, \\"Even the nighttime scenes are bright.\\"  If one is looking for Bava-inspired Argento colorization, watch \\"Suspiria\\" or the underrated \\"Inferno\\" instead.In summary, \\"Tenebrae\\" is a must-own for all serious giallo fans.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Arguably Argento\'s best", "unixReviewTime": 1018915200, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2002"}\n',

Here I am back in Europe again.  I\'m really starting to warm up to these Italian films.  I even like their mediocre movies.  But mediocre this is not!  Amazingly, this is the very first Dario Argento film that I\'ve seen.  I was going to dive into \\"Susperia\\" but was warned away by advice from my friends the \\"experts\\".  So I backed off and went for this; a simple little slasher film.  Jeez, I can be misleading!!This isn\'t complicated, but it\'s certainly not simple either.  I know, I know; \\"Just shut up and get to the point EK!!\\"-A VIRGIN TAKE ON DARIO ARGENTO.What can you say about a guy who will shoot film of his own daughter in the nude?  You can say \\"ALLRIGHT!!\\" that\'s what.  Though I would never do it (and not just because I\'d get arrested), this guy has few standards when it comes to nudity and gore other than \\"more please\\".  In the 1980\'s this was gold for horror fans.  It doesn\'t play too badly today either.  Besides those obvious deviant traits, Argento is a bold and creative visionary.  You can almost see his brain working as he tries to come up with a really creative way to shoot a scene.  Sometimes it looks pretentious.  The rest of the time it\'s bloody brilliant.  Not every shot is creative, but in the right situation; lookout!!!  Argento\'s story telling is a bit clumsy at times but he definitely had some tricks up his sleeves for \\"Tenebre\\".  I\'m not sure if I made an accurate assessment watching just one film but that\'s my take for now.-IT AINT OVER UNTIL IT\'S OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER...If you\'ve read the synopsis of \\"Tenebre\\" (and you should, because I\'m not going to tell you), you\'d know this is about a serial killer stalking an author of the titular book while reenacting the murders contained within.  I know I\'ve seen this before, but I\'m not sure where.  Regardless, it\'s a plot device Argento has some fun with.  This mystery is a real puzzler and I would have never guessed it.  However, when the mystery is solved, the murders continue.  Now, up to this point, I had no clue who the killer was.  But as soon as the suspect is revealed, I immediately unraveled the second mystery.  Yea, there\'s a second mystery and the movie is really only half over.  The great thing is, now we get more murders and some real mass carnage!  Even though I solved the second mystery as soon as it presented itself, not only was I actually surprised by the ending but I WAS COMPLETELY SUCKERED!!!-ITALIAN DUBBED.  ITALIAN FUNNY!It\'s really kind (and financially wise) of Italian film makers in general, to do these films in English.  Even American actors have their voice dubbed on occasion if something didn\'t turn out right.  They happen to be pretty good at this and it never was a distraction.  In fact, as brutally goofy as some of the dialogue was in \\"Tenebre\\" other parts were uproariously witty.  My favorite dialogue was between the author, \\"Mr. Neal\\" and the police detective.  I\'m not going to quote anything here; that would spoil the fun.  But I highly recommend you look out for these conversations because they are amongst the best in any horror film.  This detective would put \\"Columbo\\" to shame (despite amazon\'s review)!-CARNAGE.  OVER THE TOP WE GO!!!Oh yea, this carnage is way over the top!!!  It\'s absolutely beautiful.  I think I\'m going to weep (sniff).  Seriously, besides one of the coolest dog chase scenes you\'d care to see, we get a bushel of throat slashing, a peck of head splitting, a liter of impalement, a gallon of spine splitting and a quart of good old fashioned stabbing.  Throw in a pinch of dismemberment with fountains of blood and I think \\"over the top\\" is where we end up.  But carnage in itself is not a beautiful thing.  It\'s a delicate art form.  You need to set the mood.  To achieve this end, Argento kindly plays \\"Goblin\\" music just before every murder; how 80s cool is that!  Though not quite the theme from \\"Jaws\\", it sure helped me ratchet up my expectations and excitement when I heard it.  If you have only a mild tolerance for gore, you\'ll be ok.  This stuff never looks real which is why I thought it was so much fun.-ITALIAN WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO.So, what more do you want me to say?  All right, I should say something.  One thing I learned from this film about women in Italy, Rome in particular, is that they never wear bras.  In fact, they have a hard time covering the parts that matter most of the time.  Even when the try to cover things, they just end up uncovered again.  I\'ve never seen such slippery women.  The funniest part of all is when Argento basically admits he\'s a sexist pig during one scene in this movie; a badge he seems to wear with pride. Just try to get me to complain about it!-THIS IS NO MYSTERY AT ALL.If I made this film sound too goofy, I must apologize.  It really is played straight with great characters and a well paced story.  The actors all do an above average job.  What makes it so fun is the audacity of it all.  Argento is about as bold as they come when it come to creativity with a camera, gore and nudity.  I\'d never call the guy a master cinematographer, but he gets huge points for pushing the envelope.  Though I make light of it, the story is actually well thought out and cleverly pulls a fast one (or two) on the viewer.  I never even mentioned the interesting choice of scenery; some very cool places.  Make no mistake, this is not brain food.  But it won\'t bore you either.  My biggest problem may be ridiculous expectations for future Argento films currently in the mail.  If you want a bloody good time, this is for you.

Produced by the legendary David O. Selznick, it\'s a warm-hearted picture of a family of con-men who worm their way into the good graces of an lonely elderly woman living on an estate in hopes of becoming her heirs.  The movie is charming but I actually didn\'t find it that funny, yet it is very enjoyable.  Character actress Minnie Dupree steals the show in a gentle, non-hammy performance as the lonely senior - incredibly, this is one of only four films she made, the other three being rather minor efforts.Janet Gaynor and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are the nominal stars of the picture as the children of Roland Young and Billie Burke, all of them experts in swindling.  Gaynor and Fairbanks\' scenes are so unusually playful one suspects their being siblings is just another con (it\'s not).  Young and Burke are in fine form as the prententious father and dizzy mother (\\"Oh, my little girl has a birthday this year, too!\\").  Fairbanks is quite believable as a non-malicious cad but while I love Janet Gaynor and she\'s by far my favorite star of the cast, she is not very credibly cast as a professional crook, her natural sweetness and good nature just gets in the way although she does give a fine performance.  I was most impressed with Richard Carlson (film debut) playing Janet\'s beau, the young American star speaks in a most credible Scottish brogue.  This was also one of Paulette Goddard\'s first films - cast as Fairbanks\' girl - she is third-billed but doesn\'t appear in the first 40 minutes of this 91 minute movie.  This was Janet\'s last film as a star - she retired after it\'s release and returned to the screen only once in 1957 in a secondary role in a Pat Boone musical.The movie is a bit on the cute side with puppies, penguins, and sweet old ladies but what\'s wrong with that? The print quality is excellent on this DVD. Also want to note Amazon shows the DVD cover as picturing Fairbanks and Paulette Goddard.  Maybe somebody at MGM DVD didn\'t realize it wasn\'t Janet - this has apparently been corrected in later copies - my copy shows a picture of Janet in place of Paulette while Douglas remains where he was.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pleasant Family Comedy About a Family of Crooks", "unixReviewTime": 1142726400, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2006"}\n',

Why do I have to pour troops into a victory I have already won?\\"  So the movie begins as the Italian leader questions events, questions which sound eerily familiar as the guerrilla war now escalates in Iraq today.This movie is valuable on two fronts.  It is one of those rare movies giving a positive view of Arabs, one of maybe 50 movies in cinematic history (out of 900 presenting Arabs).  It is indeed strange, to see Arabs as the good guys, and Europeans as the bad ones- but a very positive strange.  And they are not just the good guys, but the very heroic, deep, philosophical, and loving good guys.  Produced by Lybia\'s Qaddafi, there certainly is a bias in this film; but it\'s pleasant to see a bias on the other side for once.  There are many very Arab nuances- how they naturally show honor and hospitality to their neighbors, things the Italians lack.  Children learning the Qur\'an by rote, as well as the wisdom of the Qur\'an.  Women coming together around the well.  Men and women working in the fields of Lybia.  These are not just the blind enemy followers of America, but a real people, in all their wondrous uniqueness.  One can learn more about this movie, and the other 850 anti-Semitic portrayals of Arabs, in Shaheen\'sReel Bad Arabs.The other extremely valuable aspect of this movie is the ammunition it provides against the myth of redemptive violence.  The movie itself is too violent and has too much gore at times- though it is history, it is not necessary to portray it so realistically.  But it also argues persuasively against imperialism, and violence itself.  \\"The Lion\\" tells his people to not shoot prisoners, for \\"We will not let our enemy be our teachers.\\" Omar here is certainly a heroic figure.  And it is truly so hard to do this, to not be taught by our enemies, for we so naturally become that which we hate.Lion has moving portrayals by Quinn, and the cinematographic ploy of interspersing real black-and-white footage from the Italian ethnic cleansing is very effective, for feeling the pain of what the Lybians went through under Italian oppression.  But it is also helpful for showing us a generally unknown freedom fighter, and that when we forget history, we repeat it.  The Italians become bogged down in guerrilla warfare in the mountains, as the Arabs hide in caves.  A great and powerful nation tried to control a Middle Eastern people, and stayed too long.  And so Omar tells a French soldier to return to his headquarters, with the remains of his flag, saying \\"It does not belong here.\\"  It\'s not that it\'s a bad flag.

After all, Akkad financed the first film and eventually took over the rest of the series. Every time you witness a new entry in the \\"Halloween\\" canon, Akkad is probably the one to blame. But few people know that Moustapha Akkad also directed epic films about Arab history in the late 1970s and early 1980s, or that these films are extraordinarily laudable cinematic pieces well worth watching today. Arab history certainly wouldn\'t rank high on anyone\'s list nowadays with the explosion in Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorist attacks of September 2001 still in the forefront of our minds. That\'s too bad because this picture starring Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger, and Oliver Reed is not only immensely watchable, it also presents a different viewpoint on the relationship between the West and the Arabic world. Most importantly, this movie shows that Moustapha Akkad hasn\'t always sat around collecting checks from his \\"Halloween\\" projects.\\"Lion of the Desert\\" opens in the year 1922 right after Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian government. As many historians know, Il Duce quickly decided one way to bolster his fascist dictatorship was to present it as a renewed Roman Empire. One of his first priorities as a conquering Augustus was to renew efforts to pacify the Bedouin tribes in the Italian colony of Libya. After ascertaining that the leader of the Bedouin resistance is a man named Omar Mukhtar, Mussolini handpicks one of his most ruthless and capable generals, Rodolfo Graziani, as the new governor of the colony. Graziani\'s mission is to go to Libya and smash these pesky desert nomads in any way he sees fit. The Italian presence in Libya dates back some twenty years, and Il Duce isn\'t about to lose the territory on his watch. His general soon sails to Libya with a few novel ideas on how to defeat the Arab resistance, and he won\'t let anyone stand in his way. Graziani is such a ruthless tyrant that even Omar Mukhtar recognizes his name when told the general is now the new governor. Mukhtar isn\'t about to just let Graziani roll over his people, while the general intends to teach Mukhtar a lesson he and his people will never forget.This movie overflows with magnificently choreographed battle sequences involving thousands of extras. Moreover, Akkad and his crew took great pains to reproduce the Italian military equipment down to the smallest details. It must have killed some of the craftsmen on the movie to watch months of painstaking labor go up in a two second explosion, something that happens on a frequent basis during the film as the Bedouins routinely destroy endless numbers of armored cars and tanks. According to the makers of \\"Lion of the Desert,\\" Graziani was the first military commander to use tanks in the desert, and the movie portrays this historic battle in expansive detail. It is difficult to say which battle sequence is the best, although I would definitely lean towards the artillery barrage in the valley when Italian field cannons open up on entrenched Bedouins in the caves on the side of a mountain. The sound and fury of this encounter looks great on DVD, with the explosions of the shells literally booming out of my sound system.The performances really make this film a winner. Rod Steiger plays Benito Mussolini with all of the swagger you would expect from an actor portraying the pompous fascist dictator. Oliver Reed works wonders as the cold-hearted Graziani. The best performance in the film is definitely Anthony Quinn\'s turn as Omar Mukhtar. Not only does he look like the actual historical figure, as seen by photographic comparisons made in one of the extras on the DVD, he strikes just the right balance of compassion and controlled ferocity. The meeting between Mukhtar and Graziani towards the end of the film fills the screen with drama, along with several statements made by Mukhtar that would apply to any conquered peoples on the face of the earth. The 162 minute runtime insures that most of the characters receive appropriate development.Arguably, the most emotional and tense scenes in \\"Lion of the Desert\\" occur when Graziani institutes his plan to put the Bedouin population in concentration camps in order to force Mukhtar and his freedom fighters to surrender. The film ingeniously stages scenes of the concentration camps and then, without missing a beat, tacks on real film footage from the Italian occupation showing an aerial view of the prisons. Unlike Hitler with the Jews, the Italians did not gas Bedouins in these camps, but thousands of Bedouins did die from poor conditions. Moreover, Graziani ordered the fields burned and the execution by both bullet and noose of innocent civilians to avenge Italian battle casualties. For a PG rated movie, the atrocities and battle deaths are extremely bloody.The DVD looks great, with a widescreen picture transfer and a slew of extras. The making of documentary outlines a score of interesting facts about the production of the film, such as the need to build an entire city in the desert to house and feed the thousands of people used during the production. According to the trailer and a few references in the making of documentary, the film originally bore the title \\"Omar Mukhtar.\\" I think the title they went with was a smart choice, however, because it makes you think about who qualifies as the real lion of the desert. Is it Graziani or is it Mukhtar? Well, it is both men as they test each other\'s mettle through years of combat.

Apparently this car doesn\'t come with a driver.  Believe it or not, despite my love of horror movies, I somehow went through life never having heard of the Car until last night.  Now I believe for the most part this movie has dated horribly and isn\'t nearly as frightening as it once was (with several moments of overlong dialogue usually taking place inside the police station) but there are a few scares that are entirely worth it.One is easily when the woman returns home, walks inside, and you see the headlights of the black car outside the window preparing to plow through the house and create what to me is clearly the most exciting moment in the entire film, and two is when the one cop played by James Brolin enters a garage and is surprised to see that the black car somehow got inside, and when he goes to unjam the doors the car gives chase.  This is sort of a hilarious moment too.  Of course, without spoiling it, the way the car is eventually destroyed and the rather frightening devil-like image we see in the smoke is another highlight.  Oh and of course the suspense that occurs whenever a gust of wind mysteriously comes out of nowhere... we know what this means!  Better run!!!Also, gotta love the way people talked back in the late 70\'s always finishing sentences with \\"why dontcha!\\" which reminds me of a certain rock album by West, Bruce and Laing from the early 70\'s.  Sometimes the car picks up speed in a way that I believe is unnatural, and this occurs in a few other instances as well, but I\'m not 100% sure it\'s fake since it\'s possible the car really is picking up speed in such a way and it\'s legitimate.The only thing I hate about this movie is when the car chases people around, but instead of seeing them dying, the film skips over the actual suspense so all we see are the people lying in the dirt when we *should* be seeing the dramatic suspense of them getting hit, flying in the air and then hitting the dirt which is a LOT better, not to mention more realistic.  I guess this is entirely due to it being a late 70\'s movie, who knows.  It makes for some unintentionally funny moments, such as when the teens riding their bikes get hit by the car and fly off their bikes.  The moment you see people getting hit compared to what happers afterwards in the very next scene with them hitting the ground never quite matches up.Overall, well to be honest I like the Car, but thank goodness the second half shows a drastic improvement with more car chases and less talking, otherwise I wouldn\'t have been so generous with my 4-star rating.  I do feel however, that James Brolin would go onto better roles such as in the Amityville Horror (one of the best horror films of all-time) and that this is more like a stepping stone for him.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "James Brolin battles a car", "unixReviewTime": 1386288000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2013"}\n',

The Car (from 1977) is one of those movies.  Summary-wise, it doesn\'t sound like much at all.  Basically, you\'ve got a killer car haunting the streets of a desert town, and James Brolin stars as the law man who has to find a way to end the car\'s reign of terror.  That\'s it, really.  You also have the fact that no one could come up with a less mundane title than The Car.  It turns out, though, that the title suits the movie quite well, as this film really is all about the car (a custom Lincoln Mark III).  It\'s a sleek, seductive, darkly charismatic, made-in-the-USA monster of a vehicle.  The king of 1970s cinematic automobiles, it could eat Herbie for lunch and scare the wax right off of Christine.A couple of bikers are the car\'s first victims, but word doesn\'t really spread until the car takes out an annoying French horn-playing hijacker.  Local explosives dude and wife-beater Amos Clements (R.G. Armstrong) is the first to witness the vehicle in action, but it isn\'t long before most of the men on the police force have seen it, as well - with an increasing number of them not living to tell about it.  When Wade Parent (Brolin) has to step in to the shoes of the sheriff (who won\'t be needing those shoes anymore), it\'s up to him to devise some plan for bringing the unknown driver to justice.  Yeah, an elderly Indian witness says that she saw no one driving the thing, but that couldn\'t be true, now could it?  With his second in command choosing that time to fall off the wagon, Wade definitely has his work cut out for him.  Among other things, he\'s got a local school marching band out practicing on the town\'s parade route.  Personally, I don\'t think it\'s a good idea to march dozens of kids up and down the middle of a public road at any time (even though Lord knows they need the practice), but it\'s especially dangerous when your town is completely at the mercy of a killer hot rod Lincoln.There are an awful lot of things that go boom in this movie.  Apart from blowing up one car before it hardly has a chance to even hit anything, the special effects are pretty darn satisfying (especially given the film\'s age).  Through it all, the killer car shows no sign of a single scratch.  Heck, you can\'t even shoot this thing with a shotgun and leave a mark - this is one tough horseless carriage.  Cursing the car out seems pretty effective, but believe me when I say this is only a temporary solution.  What\'s a person to do when even the comfort of your own home doesn\'t guarantee your safety?  Personally, I would recommend moving to the left or right when being pursued by an evil car, but everyone in this movie seems to think their only choice is to try and outrace the vehicular behemoth (whether on foot, on a bike, or in a car).The ending is a little cheesy (surprise, surprise), but I actually enjoyed this film quite a bit.  James Brolin actually turns in a decent performance, you\'ve got a fairly significant body count, and the car is just relentless in its attacks.  How do you stop something like this, especially when you begin to suspect the driver may be more than a normal man (and that\'s assuming the car actually has someone at the controls to begin with)?

So many victims and so little time, kind of reminds me of an old computer game called Carmageddon.This was a movie that was made back when big budgets were not always needed to make a good movie. The movie does not clearly dictate if anyone is in the car or not, but kinda hints that no one is. This movie might even be what inspired Steven King to write Christine.

Teenagers Pete Keil and Suzie Pullbrook\'s leisurely early morning bike ride is rudely interrupted by a spectral black sedan which crushes Suzie against a guardrail and knocks Pete screaming off of a high bridge. Subsequently, it also brutally runs down a hitchhiker.The local police, led by Sheriff Everett Peck, attempt to deal with the situation. But when Peck becomes the car\'s fourth victim in a hit and run right outside of the police station, Deputy Wade Parent must step up to the challenge. As the son of a sheriff himself, Wade has a lot to live up to. He\'s a recent divorcee, with custody of his two daughters and is also dating their teacher, Lauren Humphreys. Everyone takes Everett\'s death pretty hard, and with Wade as sheriff-by-default, he makes it the personal mission of Santa Ynez\'s police department to bring the mysterious motorist to justice.But the intimidating sedan is more than meets the eye (and no, that doesn\'t mean it\'s a Transformer). After terrorizing Lauren\'s class and chasing them into a cemetery, where it refuses to follow, a high-speed police chase ensues wherein the car proves not only bulletproof, but apparently indestructible, as it takes out two police cars using its own momentum by doing a barrel-roll over them and crushing them. Wade himself becomes convinced there may not even be a driver in the thing after all, especially after he and he alone gets a glimpse past the car\'s tinted windows...The Car is what modern horror movies wish they could be. Now, granted, the idea of an evil, driverless car (a customized black Lincoln Continental) running around killing people is more than a bit silly. But what made me really like this movie was the manner in which the human characters confront the situation. Naturally, they initially assume the car has a human driver, and go about attempting to stop him as they would any other lunatic with vehicular homicide on his mind. But after evidence surfaces that this car isn\'t what it seems to be comes to light, they change their tactics drastically.There\'s no \\"Nudge nudge, wink wink\\" self-referential humor or even any real comic relief characters (except for the hitchhiker at the start, who is actually funny and exits the picture before he has a chance to become even the least bit annoying), and everyone generally plays it totally straight, making the absurd plot work. And the final chase sequence and the showdown with the car out in a desert canyon is well worth seeing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There was no driver in the car!", "unixReviewTime": 1313280000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2011"}\n',

I missed this film when it was first released, but it was apparently overshadowed by STAR WARS. THE CAR is nevertheless one of the great movies of the 1970\'s, up there with JAWS, DUEL, THE BIG WEDNESDAY, and APOCALYPSE NOW.This film has a tense quality throughout, with many scenes shot in complete silence, keeping the viewer in anticipation as to where the car will strike next and who will be its next unfortunate victim. There is no back story; no-one knows where the mechanical fiend originated from. It just appears one day, bent on the destruction of a small desert town, casually picking off its inhabitants and any hitchhikers passing through.James Brolin plays the New Mexico town\'s sheriff, Wade Parent, who relentlessly pursues the car, trying to obtain a licence plate or a description of the driver. Roadblocks are set up, but the car dissappears without a trace following each bloody incident. The question on Wade\'s mind is: are they dealing with a homicidal maniac - or some dark phantom, a demonic otherworldly apparition?Of all the horror films based on \'killing machines\', THE CAR (1977) is one of the best. Perhaps not as good as DUEL (1971), it ranks alongside CHRISTINE (1983) and MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (1986)). Closely following are THE BLACK CADILLAC (2002), THE AMBULANCE (1990), TRUCKS (1997), THE WRAITH (1986), and ROADKILL (2001, aka JOYRIDE).Disc features: Widescreen Presentation; Full-Frame Presentation; Theatrical Trailer; Talent Biographies.Cast: James Brolin, Kathleen Lloyd, John Marley, Elizabeth Thompson, and Ronny Cox (DELIVERANCE).Director: Elliot Silverstein (A MAN CALLED HORSE).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Relentless Machines", "unixReviewTime": 1083888000, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2004"}\n',

Finally dead was the last golden era of Hollywood where the directors had free reign, killed by a social culture that no longer wanted to do much more then cheer for a winner. The shame of Watergate, and Vietnam had caused the thinking persons film to become little more then an afterthought while a world of escapist fantasy took over the pulse of American movie going culture. The three nails in the coffin were Rocky, Jaws, and then finally Star Wars as a coup de grass. The car rose out of these ashes not so much as a phoenix, but more as a mocking bird emulating the staggeringly successful plot points of Jaws tooth and nail, up to and including a climatic finish in which a giant fire devil envelopes the sky when the car explodes at the ending. The big problem of course is that the fear of sharks is a very universal primal fear shared by all of man kind across the globe, whereas demonic driverless cars is probably a fear shared by a mere handful of souls on Earth, and even these people would be mentally fragile to say the least. Nonetheless, The Car has just enough atmosphere and quirky charm that it remains til this day, a highly entertaining film to watch. Now in rating a film like this one, it is best to realise exactly what it is going in. You should not rate it along side cinematic masterpieces like Ben Herr, The Godfather, or Gandhi. The Car is a pure straight line horror film in which the monster is the main character, and outside of the obvious heroic alpha male lead, we get to sit back and watch all the other side characters get taken out one by one. It is therefor a film that unpretentiously aspires to be nothing beyond pure bubble-gum, and as such, the taunt 92 minutes is peppered with 13 deaths, giving the viewer the enjoyment of watching an average of one person get ran down every seven minutes. Along with all this fast paced action, there is some painfully funnly looking sped up Laurel and Hardy like car chase footage, kooky characters with silly dialog, really aweful looking high waist polyester pants, and a Marshall drumming saturated soundtrack which barrows its main melody from Hector Berlioz Symphony Fantastic. ( Just like with The Shining ) The main things going for this movie are the great New Mexico desert location, the use of great character actors like R.G. Armstrong, and Ronny Cox, but mostly, the coolest looking car ever put on film. The Car itself uses the body of a black 60\'s Lincoln Continental with a cropped and lowered roof, dingy orange tinted windows, and a rounded two fanged bumper that looks like it was lifted off of a 1930\'s pick-up truck. Unfortunately the US version of The Car is quit pricey, that is why I suggest getting a zone-free DVD player and buying the British copy of the film which plays on PAL 2,4,&5 signals. I own this British copy myself and can testify that the picture quality looks great. Since films like The Car, The Stepfather, Hardware, Innocence, Last House on Dead Ends Street, Santa Sangre etc. either cost too much to own an American copy of, or flat out do not exist in NTSC, owning a region-free DVD player is a must for any discerning film lover. Finally I suggest watching The Car with Race With The Devil as a double bill, or to play The Car at any gathering including as background footage at a party.P.S. Is it just me or does The Car\'s silliest acting performer, Kathleen Lloyd, have a rather uncanny resemblance to Sarah Silverman?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Land Shark.", "unixReviewTime": 1202515200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2008"}\n',

The suspense builds slowly and it is the kind of film best watched on a rainy night with a big bowl of popcorn.Nicholas Musuraca\'s photography captures the menace of the wind and rain in this truly old-fashioned tale of suspense and romance. Dorothy McGuire shines as the mute Helen under Robert Siodmak\'s uncluttered direction. Roy Webb, famous for many great scores at RKO, adds another fine one to his list in this Dore Schary production from Selznick. This is a film of atmosphere and performance rather than nail-biting tension. As with many of Ethel Lina White\'s novels brought to film, the movie is actually better than the book.The film opens as the mute Helen appropriately watches a silent film while a killer on the loose preys once more on a young woman with an imperfection. Helen is very aware of her own limitations but the young town doctor is in love with her and believes she can be helped to speak once again. When it becomes evident that the killer is connected somehow to the old mansion where Helen takes care of the ill Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), she is soon in great danger because of her affliction.From there it is only a matter of figuring out just who Helen should be wary of. An old spiral staircase and a single rainy night will reveal much. The two very different sons of Mrs. Warren offer latent hostility and intrigue while Dr. Parry tries to protect and warn her, as does the sick Mrs. Warren. Rhonda Fleming offers a sexy contrast to McGuires\'s wholesome mute girl as the secretary romancing the wayward brother Steven. A fine cast that includes Kent Smith as the doctor, George Brent as the responsible son, and Elsa Lanchester round out the players in this gothic style drama.A shy kiss between Helen and Dr. Parry in a doorway sets the tone for the film, which is very old-fashioned suspense and romance. McGuire has some wonderful moments throughout the film. One such is when she is daydreaming of her marriage to Dr. Parry which becomes a nightmare beacause she cannot utter \\"I do\\" at the alter. The pace is slow and deliberate but works because of a wonderful ending, especially the final shot.Those expecting grandiose tension and suspense will probably be disappointed upon seeing this film for the first time. Those who can ignore all the hype of its reputation, however, will find much to love in its gothic atmosphere and old-fashioned romance.

Could Helen (Dorothy McGuire) be next?  Following an horrific event in her past, Helen has lived her life as a mute.  Employed as companion to the bedridden Mrs Warren (Ethel Barrymore), Helen is told that her life is in danger and she must leave the house immediately.

So is stylish noir director Robert Siodmak who really knows how to translate troubled inner worlds into complex camera effects. Together, they transform the hoary elements of a maniacal killer, a spooky old mansion, and a houseful of suspects, into a memorable movie experience.I paricularly like the opening sequence where a 1900\'s audience sits watching an early feature length film, The Kiss. The rest of the audience sits stoically, not knowing what to make of the new-fangled experience. However, Mc Guire\'s simple servant girl sits enraptured, absolutely transfixed, her luminous eyes suffering along with the endangered heroine, whose predicament curiously foreshadows Mc Guire\'s own plight yet to come. I doubt that any actress has won over an audience any faster than during those few seconds.Credit should also go to that terrific RKO tandem of art director Albert D\'Agostino and set director Darrel Silvera, whose artistic eye helped lift that studio into the pantheon of 1940\'s black & white. Together, they manage to keep a single set, the old house, from becoming boring to look at, while perfectly complementing Siodmak\'s own gothic sensibilities.Still, there is a downside. Poor Kent Smith plays the young doctor. Technically, he\'s a competent enough actor; however, his charisma factor registers somewhere between  dull gray and dried cement. Here his rather smarmy physician appears to have wandered over from the set of Young Doctor Kildare. Fortunately, his screen time is limited.In compensation are the wonderfully daffy Elsa Lanchester as the cook, and Carleton the dog as Carleton the dog, perhaps the most beautifully ugly face in the history of canine thespians. Also, making an impressive appearance is an apparent forerunner of hurricane Katrina , howling and thundering for the entire ninety minutes in true gothic fashion.Anyhow, this is a genuinely artistic suspenser from RKO\'s golden period, proving once again why Hollywood\'s eventual stampede to technicolor was not an unmixed blessing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Steer Clear of the Wine Cellar", "unixReviewTime": 1155513600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2006"}\n',

I\'ll leave you to speculate on the Freudian subtext there.So unsurprisingly people are worried about Helen, a young mute woman (although for some reason, Helen doesn\'t seem concerned much). Helen lives in an old gothic mansion some miles from town, working as the companion to an elderly, crabby lady who keeps uttering vague warnings of death\'n\'doom. Also present: an exasperated nurse, the cook and her hubby, and the old lady\'s son and stepson.So when a thunderstorm hits and the old woman has an attack of... whatever she\'s suffering from, Helen\'s doctor boyfriend goes rushing off to get ether. However, someone is watching Helen from inside the house, and this person is determined to kill her before the night is out...As a mystery, \\"The Spiral Staircase\\" is pretty flawed. Helen spends the entire movie ignoring warnings of death\'n\'doom from... pretty much everybody, then is apparently shocked when the serial killer goes after her. Also: it\'s kind of obvious from the start who the murderer is, if nothing else because all the red herrings point so strongly to the only other suspect. It would have been nice if they had made us wonder about the other characters.But as a psychological thriller, this is a solid piece of work. Robert Siodmak fills the entire movie with a haunted, claustrophobic atmosphere, with huge shadows and dark stairwells. And he creates some wonderfully creepy moments as well -- the scene where the murderer sees Helen as a mouthless woman is pretty spine-chilling.And Dorothy McGuire is another reason to overlook the movie\'s shortcomings. She does an excellent job playing a naive, often terrified young girl, but doesn\'t go over the top with the physical acting.

The director manages to conjure up an  effective feeling of dread and claustrophobia - this is a long, long way  from William Castle\'s amiable ghost frolic The House on Haunted Hill which  played more like a farce than a thriller.

Having not yet seen \\"Omega Code\\" and after having been profoundly disappointed (and, yes, BAD bored) with the recent \\"Left Behind,\\" I had a sort of \\"HO-hum\\" attitude when I saw this advertised at the local marquee.  Regardless, at my wife\'s behest, we saw it last Saturday night, and it - literally - was a religious experience.  I\'m no Biblical scholor, but \\"Megiddo\\" seemed to be quite Scripturally correct, drawing almost directly from the Books of Daniel and Revelations.  And I was very satisfied with the movie\'s resolution.  One minor quibbling point, though: at the beginning of the movie, when it is trying to establish Stone Alexander\'s character, the writers seem to have borrowed greatly from the first two installments of the \\"Omen\\" series of some 25 years ago:  Stone\'s the son of a political figure, he has an evil \\"supernatural guardian,\\" and he first starts showing his...\\"true disposition\\" while at a military school. Even Michael Beihn, the protagonist, the \\"good guy\\" of \\"Megiddo,\\" favors Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael York\'s character, the Antichrist, in \\"Omen.\\"  However, York\'s portrayal of this dispicable character is more realistic, a tad less smarmy, less \\"Hollywood\\" than was the \\"Omen\'s\\" Damien Thorn.

In the legendary first series we are introduced to politician Richard Bellamy (David Langton), his beautiful wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  Downstairs, their staff, Hudson the butler (Gordon Jackson), Mrs Bridges the cook (Angela Baddeley), Rose the maid (Jean Marsh) and Emily the scullery maid (Evin Crowley) attempt to uphold their own values whilst coming to grips with an ever-changing world.Originally-devised by actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, the series explored the day-to-day life of servant and master in the Edwardian period, a time of great political and social upheaval. The series later took the Bellamy family into the First World War (Series 4, regarded by most as the greatest), the 1920s flapper period and the impending Stock Market crash (Series 5).As the series opens, it is the year 1903, and great changes are afoot for the Bellamy family.\\"On Trial\\" - Into the structured Bellamy household whirls the unconventional free-spirit Clemence Delise (Pauline Collins) who is applying for the new position of parlourmaid.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she is quickly inducted into the residence, but it soon becomes clear that Sarah\'s true calling isn\'t in domestic service.\\"The Mistress and the Maids\\" - Lady Marjorie sits for an important society painter, but it\'s Sarah who enflames his creative talents.\\"Board Wages\\" - When the Bellamy\'s leave London for the weekend, Sarah and the servants are left to their own devices.  But when James unexpectedly returns home early, Sarah is thrown into a dilemma which could see her walk away from Eaton Place.\\"The Path of Duty\\" - Elizabeth returns home from a German finishing school, but her stubborn, willful streak is still very much intact.  When she must make her formal society debut, Elizabeth exposes her parents to a huge scandal by running away.\\"A Suitable Marriage\\" - The visiting Baron von Rimmer seems the perfect prospective husband for Elizabeth...or is he?\\"A Cry for Help\\" - Richard becomes entangled in scandal when the new maid appeals for his assistance in a delicate private matter.\\"Magic Casements\\" - Lady Marjorie enjoys a tender but brief affair with one of James\' military friends.\\"I Dies from Love\\" - Emily becomes infatuated with a footman, leading to dire consequences when her affections are not returned.\\"Why Was Her Door Locked?\\" - An emotionally-distraught Mrs Bridges plunges the Bellamy family into disgrace when she kidnaps a baby.\\"A Voice from the Past\\" - Whilst helping in a soup kitchen, James and Elizabeth stumble onto a homeless Sarah, and decide to take her back to Eaton Place.  The situation becomes complicated when Elizabeth learns of James\' affair with Sarah during her previous employment at the house.\\"The Swedish Tiger\\" - Sarah becomes a pawn in a plan to rob the Bellamy\'s of priceless antiques.\\"The Key of the Door\\" - Elizabeth comes of age, but her headstrong attitude once again causes friction with her parents, when she befriends Evelin Larkin and her group of socialists.\\"For Love of Love\\" - Elizabeth finally marries poet Lawrence Kirbridge at the request of her parents, and James rekindles his affair with Sarah, who is now a music-hall singer.Due to a technician\'s strike in 1971, the first six episodes were taped in black-and-white, and an alternate colour version of the first episode was filmed later on, for broadcasters who didn\'t wish to screen the black and white episodes.  In the colour broadcasts, Sarah leaves at the end of the first episode \\"On Trial\\", but the complete B&W;/colour inclusive series has her leave at the end of \\"Board Wages\\".

After airing of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec \'10). 3 episodes (alas only 3) advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh who is in both the old and new) and also now including Atkins as Maud. You get the same house, same music, same title. After \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" the pair of actresses combined again in creating \\"The House of Elliott\\", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own \\"complete collection.\\"No disappointment from me or my wife with the 2010 3 episode addition compared to the older TV blockbuster series. The new cast keeps up the believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house (+ music) gives the old lovers the flavor of the past, even if the interior has been redecorated to 1936. It takes only the 1st episode to fall in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165. Excellent cast. With the long bonus feature, there is a hint at more. For me...like handing a fat man a box of chocolates and asking, \\"Do you want more?\\" YES!Interesting that they had the \\"to be King Geo VI\\" in the show, prior to the abdication of his King brother, and he did not stutter. After the success of \\"The King\'s Speech\\" about the same time as this series release, that bit of trivia is evident.As for the original \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" series. It is 27-year span epic winning 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy\'s of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70\'s and worth owning today. Since it\'s period drama it never goes out of style. It\'s a British TV saga classic.Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do\') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady\'s-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless. I strongly recommend you get the 40th Collection and see it while waiting for the new 21st century produced episodes DVD to be released.This newest release (40th Anniversary Collection) provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE! Compare that to the new release with only 3 episodes.SUBTITLES-Anniversary set OFFERS SUBTITLES,like the new episodes. Helpful for some of us. A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.And YES, I bought the new 3 episodes to go with the older episodes.

Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen\'s strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.

It does a good job of showing how the servant situation had changed in 20 years--much more difficult to get domestic assistance as qualified as that before the first war. But Rose does her best with what she has, and the result is a huge help for a struggling young diplomat. (Though the aging sequence is still tricky--when the first series closes in 1930, she should be late 40\'s or 50, but still looks 30-35; when the new series opens in 1936, she def. looks well over 60; but that problem existed with the Bellamy father and son, too, when they looked more like brothers as the first series neared its close.)These episodes, however, although beautifully produced, lacked development, which the earlier series of UpDown displayed so beautifully; of course, the notoriously short attention-span of the modern viewer, and the expense of such a production, were probably prohibative, but we really did not have quite enough time to grow attached to the characters--except perhaps for the Jewish lady, a refugee who becomes a maid. Jean Marsh was wonderful, as was Eileen Atkins; and the ambassador\'s wife did show some character development, I thought, but her sister seemed hopeless, a puzzling lack of compassion in someone so young. I did think her brother-in-law, the diplomat himself, was very well done--it is difficult in this day and age to play a noble character convincingly, and he did; the ship steward/new butler was also a very endearing character, and the young maid, too.So much preferred it to Downtown--far less soap-opera like, but could have been fleshed out for a superior product; a continuation to see if 165 Eaton Place survives WWII would be very interesting.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great potential; edges over Downtown soap-opera, just.", "unixReviewTime": 1303776000, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2011"}\n',

I decided to try it now, since I knew it had a similar premise to DA. It wasn\'t \\"love at first sight,\\" but by the third episode I was hooked.

As some other reviewers mentioned, it is set up more like a play with limited sets, and I find the characters on DA more attractive and likeable, but the characters in UD have grown on me the more I watch. There are some similarities where I think DA may have copied UD.I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said there should be subtitles/closed captioning. I always use the subtitle option when available, esp. when watching something where the actors have an accent. There\'s nothing wrong with my hearing, but I don\'t think anyone catches every single word of every single movie, and subtitles do help in this regard. The British accent can sometimes be hard to decipher, esp when the actors talk faster or more quietly.

I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2, one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I\'ll take what I can get!The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (on film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland\'s, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam\'s eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes\' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played the upper house parlour maid, and later ladies\' maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank). There\'s also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law\'s wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance. She also develops an interest in right-wing activities involving the fascist movement in Britain, a thread that was unfortunately rushed through during the course of the three episodes. Another thread explored this season was the relationship between Wallis Simpson with Edward VIII and the abdication crisis.I liked this first season, but would have liked to see more time spent on developing the main characters. It all seemed a bit rushed, as if the writers and producers were trying to cram as much as they could into the three episodes. I hope to see more time being spent on plot and character development next season.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Still prefer the original, but this updated version has excellent production qualities", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}\n',

Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.A few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn\'t stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.I loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.If however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.

Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.Ciaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester!

With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don\'t look!).

I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre.

I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version.

Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered &quot;ugly.&quot; Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte\'s novel.I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre.

Schrecker \\"KJS\\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I love Charlotte Bronte\'s novel, Jane Eyre, and I\'ve read it several times.  Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre.  I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.However, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons.  First, the casting was perfect.  Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret.  He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably.  Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre.  She is my favorite of all the female leads to date.  She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch.  (Jane is supposed to be \\"plain.\\")  Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part.  She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer.  She is Jane Eyre in my eyes.  The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!!  Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.The production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation.  I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating.  Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn\'t seem like it could come out of his throat.  If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.As for the other versions I have seen, I\'ll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:3)  2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender:  My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality.  Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too \\"blonde\\".  Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man.4)  2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:  Non-descript actors, but a decent production.  Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable.5)  1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York:  Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so/so version, nothing too much going on here.6)  2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg:  I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part.  Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here.  Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality.  This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention.  NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none.7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, \\"Do you find me handsome?\\" and she answers \\"No.\\"  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn\'t a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol\' Tim wouldn\'t have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can\'t expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the BEST!", "unixReviewTime": 1350518400, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2012"}\n',

However, I have read the SparkNotes on this novel as well as Fielding\'s own words that he desired the novel to be like a feast to the reader. I also know that the literary society did not take kindly to Fielding\'s novel due to its vulgar content.This production of Tom Jones certainly is vulgar in comparison with many other A&E; or BBC productions. Yet, I do not think the film does so against the novel. The novel does not use the best language, and while producers of films much always decide how much action to TELL/IMPLY and how much to SHOW, I do not think this production shows too much.Fielding\'s novel is not like a work of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. Therefore, the production should not try to transform Fielding\'s style into that of a more modest and politically-correct writer.As for the acting of the characters, I believe most actors conveyed their characters well. The film was certainly humorous, which I am sure was the intent of the productors. Additionally, the film kept the introductory passages were an actor playing Fielding speaks about the work.Overall, I do not regret purchasing and watching this production. I thought it was quite good - a mix between a drama and a comedy, where manners are neglected and violence abundant, but all in a way that seems like a 1960s TV comedy show.PS: Even the scenes where characters are intoxicated or lose their tempers do not appear too graphic. I am of the opinion most high school students have been at parties were more realistic drunkenness occured than this production shows. As for the violence between characters, especially between Squire Western and his daughter, Sophia, I am rather convinced that 21st century X-box and Playstation games contain just as much violence - and violence that appears more real than any shown in this film.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "comedy of manners and violence", "unixReviewTime": 1242518400, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2009"}\n',

This film has a dark ending, but the production itself is not.  There are many light moments to overcome the tragedy that is unfolding.  Tess is a traveller on a road towards her inevitable fate, a fate that seems typical of Thomas Hardy.  Much like Antigone in the play, once the clock is wound and events are set in motion, the outcome becomes unavoidable.  Justine Waddell as Tess is beautiful as a sixteen year old and even more so four years later, but when she is forced to do hard labor to earn a living, she has the mannerisms, the walk and the talk of a laborer who is worn down by the grind.  As the charming Angel, Oliver Milburn is pleasant and then downright disgusting in his betrayal of Tess.  The actor did a great job as the loving courter and then the creep that rejected her.  Then he came back after he decided he could forgive her.  Even though it was kind of cute, I was thinking:  What a jerk.  He\'s forgiving her after all she went through!  Even in the end when he was trying to finally be the loving husband that he should have been to begin with, I couldn\'t forgive him.  I felt that it was only the now twisted mind of Tess that allowed her to forgive him.  And there was Jason Flemying as Alec, the D\'eurberville that wasn\'t.  He loved Tess in his own way, she declared. Well he did.  This guy went above and beyond the call of duty to love and care for Tess, but she would not love him.  Yes, he did rape her, and he never knew the consequences until it was too late.  For Tess, much that people did to right their wrongs was \'too late\'.  I did not find this DVD to be depressing.  It was vintage Hardy and very well done.  Also, I did not see this as a romance at all.  This was a tragedy to be played out.  I was also impressed by the work scenes, in the fowl farm and later in part 2 on the farm where Tess was working.  Very depressing working conditions that demonstrated how far the lady had fallen.

While he celebrates his good fortune, his daughter dances in her creamy dress with her friends wearing lace shawls and bonnets. There is a sense of peace and happiness in a secluded part of the world. A place you never imagine could foster such exquisite pain.Tess (Justine Waddell) seems reticent and reluctant. She is torn between her responsibility to her family and finding her own happiness. In harsh times, she chooses to try her best at finding support for her family.In her reluctance, she casts a mysterious spell about herself and this seems to make her irresistible. Riding alone with a handsome man in a mysterious forest seems a fantasy at first. Then, when she draws the wrong man to her inner circle and he takes her by force, we doubt she will be able to love again. Once her mother releases her into this wolf\'s forest, she is never safe again. His love is damaging to her in all the worst ways.Not only does she become pregnant, her child dies and she must now carry this secret with her to her grave or be shunned by men who are more understanding of their own lusts, than of her forced submission after only a casual dalliance. Since she doesn\'t love Alec (Jason Flemying), she decides not to marry him. Although, if she did marry him, she could have lived in a beautiful Victorian mansion complete with wood floors and ferns in planters on pedestals. She is offered wealth again and again.I love this movie for so many reason. Not only can you escape to the English countryside, there are beautiful scenes of family life by fireplaces and country life on farms. Milk sloshes in wooden buckets and milkmaids are still innocent enough to cry when kissed.Just when we think Tess is safe, she falls in love with Angel Clare (Oliver Milburn). He sees her as a goddess, perhaps Demeter. Little does he know how true his words are, as Demeter was the goddess of fertility and was also raped. They played with this idea throughout the movie in subtle ways. Tess is seen holding grain, she is very fertile and she is raped. Through Tess\' experiences with suffering and grief, she learns to empathize with others and eventually almost sacrifices her body for the love of her family.Then, her past comes back to haunt her in the worst ways. This is tragedy at its best, if there is such an idea. I loved this adaptation of Thomas Hardy\'s novel. However, I kept waiting for scenes I\'d thought I\'d seen before. Then, I realized I had mistaken this movie for Roman Polanski\'s 1980 adaptation. Both movies are excellent and will keep your attention right to the last second. Now I have a good excuse to watch  \\"Tess.\\" If you love comparing adaptations, it is well worth the extra time.Incredible acting, gorgeous scenery and a tragedy with so much irony and drama, you can\'t believe anyone could have luck this bad. Or was it just decisions the characters made in the direction of their own tragic ends? Should Tess have followed her heart to begin with and would that have made all the difference? Should you really tell your lover all your faults on your wedding night? This movie is not only stunning in its beauty, it also makes you think on a deeper level about a number of situations and how you would deal with them if you were Tess.One of the most compelling tragedies I\'ve ever seen and I\'m happy to say I enjoyed this adaptation as much as the 1980 version. Both are almost three hours in length.

Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol?6) \\"Two\'s A Crowd\\" Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference7) \\"Too Many Christmas Trees\\" is one of my fav episodes.  Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends.  He invites Emma to tag along.

My admiration has not diminished for this groundbreaking series. Leave it to the classy Brits to come up with the first \\"strong woman\\" of television. The first time I saw Diana Rigg as \\"Mrs. Emma Peel\\", I was hooked. Don\'t get me wrong, I loved Patrick Macnee as \\"John Steed\\", so cool in his fabulous English suits and walking stick. But, it was Mrs. Peel that had me fascinated. Oh, the excitement I\'d feel when she donned one of her skin-tight body suits, then you KNEW a battle was soon to follow. One of the best things about this series, and one that was remarkable for that time, was the equality of both their characters. Steed had total respect for Mrs. Peel, and she got him out of many scrapes, usually dispatching her opponent with a few karate chops. To see a woman, indeed an incredibly sexy woman, display strength, power, intelligence, and beauty, all in one portrayal, was absolutely unheard of at that time. What they had is called CHEMISTRY, and, it is rare. Though partners against the evil forces that be, who used their brains as much as their physical prowess, their underlying flirtation with each other via witty repartee never waned, and was a big part of their success. I must admit to sadness when Diana Rigg\'s Mrs. Peel left the series. I tried to get into the new character, a lovely Brit girl whose name was, I think, Linda Thorson(?). But, no, Mrs. Peel was irreplacable, my heart was broken, and I, like many, abandoned the series from that point on. Though this  dvd contains one of my favorite episodes, \\"The Cybernauts\\", I still intend on getting the entire \\"Mrs. Peel\\" collection, it\'s on my future \\"must-have\\" list. This series also had one of my all-time favorite intros, it excites to this day. Maybe those younger will not totally appreciate the lack of computerized special effects of this time period. But, for me, there was more excitement, beauty, and intelligence in Diana Riggs Mrs. Peel than in any Anjelia Jolie opus.

The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed\'s first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson\'s catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed\'s new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting.

True Believers can sing every note of the  &quot;Lumber Jack Song&quot; and repeat with proper inflections every word  of the &quot;Dead Parrot Sketch&quot;--although I doubt if anyone,  including Cleese himself, could name all the cheeses in the &quot;Cheese  Shop Sketch.&quot; Never since &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; has a comedy  series gathered such a fanatic following.Well, by this time in  history, A&amp;E has released the first three seasons on tape and DVD.

Just keep hitting the select button on your remote and you will  eventually see the episode. There is also a choice on the main menu to Play  All. It is because of this feature, I am told, that your display will not  show the time elapsed or the track you are on during each episode, nor will  your on-screen display show the time. If you find how to bring it up, the  submenu will give you a list of the major sketches, but you had better take  notes.In fact, I simply kept open my copy of Robert Ross\'s  &quot;Monty Python Encyclopedia&quot; (TV Books, 1997) to keep track of  where I was. Still, the format is a lot better than the tapes when it comes  to timing but very difficult to fast forward to any desired sketch.So  if you have not yet decided on the format, I would suggest the DVD,  especially with the extra bits of information they provide that are not  found on the tapes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For lovers of the Completely Different", "unixReviewTime": 962236800, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2000"}\n',

Becky Sharp is the first anti-heroine in English literature. Thakeray looks down his nose at all of his characters.  After getting into the novel you discover that the author himself is the hero of the novel in that he thinks his intelligence and opinions are far better than anyone elses.  With that understood you can sit back and enjoy his biting observations of the hypocracy of English society of the time:  the arbitrary class divisions, the frantic scrambling to find a suitable (read Wealthy) husband, and the leeming-like rush for everyone in the upper classes to live well beyond there means at the very real risk of bankrupcy.This is not Austen with a put-upon heroine that you can identify with. This is not Dickens with suffering and noble Poor and where goodness is always rewarded.This A&E;/BBC version is a very close adaptation of the book and does not sugar-coat anything.

Bernabo", "helpful": [14, 16], "reviewText": "\\"Vanity Fair,\\" first published serially in 1847-48, is William Makepeace Thackeray\'s tale of the fortunes of two women.  On the one hand we have the ambitious and amoral Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a struggling painter and a French opera singer, and on the other the passive Amelia Sedley, the wellborn but sheltered daughter of rich merchant. The two young women meet at Miss Pinkerton\'s Academy for young ladies, where Becky is a tutor of French and Amelia a student, and become friends. We then follow their intertwined lives as Jane tries to climb the social ladder and Amelia follows the dictates of her heart.\\"Vanity Fair\\" is celebrated for Thackeray\'s disparaging and negative portrait of the upper classes of early 19th-century England. The characters are rather vile, the relationships are hopelessly doomed, and readers who were not the targets of Thackeray\'s pen have enjoyed it ever since.  Like others I watched this BBC mini-series version of \\"Vanity Fair\\" after watching the recent theatrical film from director Mira Nair with Reese Witherspoon as Becky Sharp.  Ironically, Natasha Little, who plays Becky in this mini-series, plays Lady Jane Sheepshanks in the movie version.  I was bothered by the decision to make Becky nicer, because stripped of her amorality the point of the character is lost.  By the end of the first scene on the BBC version I knew that Little\'s Becky was indeed an amoral vixen.  The problem is that she does not seem to be smart enough about it to really win our sympathies, and that results in us being detached from the story emotionally.Becky Sharp has long been considered the prototype for Margaret Mitchell\'s Scarlett O\'Hara, which is an apt perspective in terms of the character\'s literary heritage.  But whereas we root for Scarlett to save Tara, win Rhett, and overcome all her other obstacles, Becky goes her merry way without our really caring about her one way of the other.  True, the subtitle for \\"Vanity Fair\\" is \\"A Novel Without a Hero,\\" but there is a sense of irony since the focus is primarily on the two young women, and all of the men are ultimately orbiting around them one way or the other.  Still, even in such a social satire I want to at least enjoy the anti-heroine\'s progression, even if I find her unsympathetic (Shakespeare\'s \\"Richard III\\" is unsympathetic, and I find him fascinating).This mini-series was written by Andrew Davies and directed by Marc Munden, and the fault in Becky Sharp\'s characterization belongs more to them than it does Little\'s performance (Frances Grey plays Amelia).  There is a scene early on where Becky impulsively decides to steal some things as she is sent packing, and I found myself thinking not so much that she was bold but that she was being stupid.  What you have to remember is that Becky Sharp is disingenuous to one and all.  The only point in the entire drama where I felt she was stripped to honest emotion and thoughts about anyone other than herself is when on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo her husband, Rawdon Crawley (Nathaniel Parker), otherwise known as her entrance into high society, is telling her what she needs to know if he does not come back.  At that moment she has the good graces to pay attention, treat the matter seriously, and not let what might be her husband\'s last memory of her be anything other than honest concern for his safety.The script certainly is faithful to Thackeray\'s novel, but time and time again I found the acting to be a bit too formal, even given the conventions of the time and place (David Bradley as the Sir Pitt being the exception that proves the rule).  Maybe I made a mistake watching the mini-series so soon after the theatrical film, because I tended to favor the performances in the latter, which is usually not the case when I am talking about a BBC version of a literary adaptation versus a theatrical release.  Davies makes a major decision, understandable but still a major mistake from my perspective, in deciding to forgo a narrator, since that is the only way to get a lot of Thackeray\'s satire and wit into the proceedings.  Since this is a BBC production so we are talking the same level of production standards we always expect to see from such period pieces.

She\'s more proper and more restrained than Paltrow.  The scene that sticks in my mind most is her face after Knightley chews her out for being mean to Miss Bates.I definitely preferred this George Knightley.  Davies does a better job of showing Knightley as a person rather than a plot mover; it was far clearer that he was a responsible landowner, riding out to check on his workers and striking up a friendship with a tenant farmer like Robert Martin.  He also feels older than Emma in this version, as it was in the book.  Mark Strong, of course, is an excellent actor and does this character wonderfully.One of the strengths of this version is its Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.  This Frank is good, but then it\'s not hard to beat the Miramax version, which had me laughing (at it).  Olivia Williams, though, was to me the memorable Jane Fairfax: quiet, put-upon, long-suffering - she captured Jane Fairfax in a nutshell.  Williams\' performance drove home what every reader and viewer feels at the end: Jane deserves so much more than that jerk Churchill.  Loved it.Lucy Robinson, fresh from being the annoying yes-woman Mrs. Hurst to Anna Chancellor\'s Caroline Bingley, is Mrs. Elton; Samantha Morton, Harriet Smith.  Both are good performances, and at least for me, on par with their Hollywood counterparts.  Of course, Harriet drives me nuts with her spinelessness, so I\'m not a good person to judge any Harriet Smith.A definite plus: showing Emma\'s nephew.  A key line running through the novel is Emma\'s reluctance for George Knightley to marry.  She believes she doesn\'t want Knightley to marry because of disinheritance; Emma\'s older sister is married to George\'s younger brother, and their son (Emma and George\'s nephew) Henry is George Knightley\'s heir.  Emma says her primary fear is that Henry will be disinherited if Knightley marries and produces a son, and that is her ostensible reason for opposing Mrs. Weston\'s suggestion that Knightley favors Jane Fairfax and Harriet\'s affection for Knightley.  It\'s not until later she realizes that her own feelings for Knightley are playing as large a role as Henry\'s disinheritance in her reluctance for him to marry.  This aspect comes out very well in this version of \\"Emma\\".If I had to choose one (which I didn\'t; I have both), I\'d choose this one.

Greenbaum", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "Kate Beckinsale\'s interpretation of the wealthy young lady who finds that matchmaking doesn\'t always go as one planned and winds up finding love right under her nose is delightful to watch.  Mark Strong plays Mr. Knightley, the slightly unconventional landowner who goes from lecturing Emma to loving her (or perhaps it was both at the same time) in a convincing, reserved fashion.The film contains most, if not all, of the plot elements of the novel.  Unfortunately, to make it fit in an hour and forty minutes or so, there isn\'t always as much flesh on those bones as one would like, and parts of the plot are hurried over quickly.  One would wish that they had done as they did with the A&amp;E Pride and Prejudice and made this a two-part, four-hour film.  Some of the cuts are ill-made.  After considerable discussion (in novel and film) of Harriet\'s illegitimate origins, the film never clears it up as the book does.  And, on an opposite note, the romance between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is made too blatant.  The outcome will hardly be a surprise to the watcher, even the watcher unfamiliar with the book.Granted, Austen has very little use for the lower classes in her books--a servant is never given life, he merely serves to announce a visitor or carry a message.  That\'s not criticism, that is simply how it is.  But scenes of the lower classes gawking as our more wealthy characters ride through Highbury--or servants gasping as they carry heavy boxes into a house or up a hill--are interesting the first time to set forth the boundaries of Austen\'s world and indulge in a little commentary on same.  But the fourth time, as servants gasp as they trundle boxes down Box Hill or move pads to cushion the knees of the gentry strawberry pickers at Donwell Abbey--well, enough already.  We got your point.  Don\'t belabor it (pun intended).Still, great to watch.

(I shall refer to this version as \\"E96\\".) An Austen-obsessive friend of mine said I MUST see this 1997 version (\\"E97\\") with Kate Beckinsale in the title role. So, unsolicited, she mailed me her own personal copy to view at my earliest convenience, which I interpreted as immediately. Sigh -  friendship\'s demands are a heavy load. However, since the storyline of E97 is pretty much like E96, I can provide the same synopsis.Beckinsale plays Emma Woodhouse, who lives with her father at Hartfield, an example of the country manor house common to all Austen storylines. Having just engineered the marriage of her governess to a rich neighbor, the 21- year old Emma decides to take up match making as a career. After all, it\'s Regency England and there\'s not much for a genteel single lady to do to allay rural boredom. Drawing pints at the local pub to build up the college fund isn\'t an option. Anyway, most needful of assistance is best friend Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton), a respectable enough girl of dubious lineage for whom Emma has plans. Perhaps she can maneuver Harriet into marrying the vicar, Reverend Elton (Dominic Rowan), rather than the local hayseed whom she loves. Meddling in affairs of the heart is a sticky wicket, but someone has to do it, especially in the absence of a licensed yenta.And what of Emma\'s own romantic prospects? There appear to be none in the virtual hail of misdirected cupid\'s arrows. True, Hatfield hosts the frequent visits of the 30-something Mr. Knightley (Mark Strong), a well-mannered and well-heeled bachelor from down the carriage road. But he\'s Emma\'s brother-in-law, a long standing relationship that seems to preclude anything of prurient interest. And he occasionally scolds Emma for her bratty behavior. Hmm, perhaps they\'re made for each other. You think?I\'m giving E97 the same number of stars, four, as I gave E96, and for the same reason, which is that the screen versions of Austen\'s PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999) are better in comparison.The costuming, sets and props of this EMMA seemed more authentic than the previous, but that\'s an impression based on no expertise whatsoever. Perhaps it was the lighting, which, in E96, seemed more luminescent. And E97\'s screenplay did more to develop the nuances of the relationships between the various players, but not so much that it made any difference in my lackadaisical appreciation of Austen\'s works as a whole. Strong\'s Knightley was a more interesting character than Jeremy Northam\'s in E96. While the former was no less a gentleman than the latter, this Knightley had a more smoldering intensity. Some latent kinkiness, perhaps? Morton\'s Smith was more endearingly pathetic than Toni Collette\'s in the earlier rendering. And E97 links Emma\'s final happiness to some imaginary (or not?) chicken thieves. A nice touch, that.The bottom line to my comparison has to be GP versus KB in the lead. The latter\'s Emma  took herself and her mission much more seriously, and verged on being annoyingly snooty in the process. Paltrow\'s Emma, on the other hand, had a blithely lighter touch. It\'s as if she was giving the audience a wink and an elbow\'s nudge. I would much rather spend an afternoon on the English heath with a picnic basket and GP\'s Emma than KB\'s. So, my vote as the film that deserves watching, if you can only see one, is E96.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "EMMA redux", "unixReviewTime": 1044144000, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2003"}\n',

Before the proliferation of TV networks geared toward science, nature, documentaries, and everything else in the universe--this was as comprehensive a look at our solar system as was ever put on television. Twelve years later, the series may be showing some signs of its age and may, in parts, seem dated. However, as television history as well as a fascinating look at a world beyond earth, this is still an invaluable viewing experience. Many of the segments could appropriately be utilized in introducing the solar system to a new generation of aspiring scientists and students. So I hope this reissue raises awareness of the program and finds new viewers.The program is broadcast in eight episodes over four discs. Besides the requisite interviews with contributors from every field of science and space exploration, the series focuses on the technology and personnel that have driven the space programs. I particularly admired that it viewed the phenomenon on a global scale. Not only do we see the American space endeavors and the impact of NASA, but there is also time spent looking at issues from the vantage point of the Russian program. It is solid history and the chronology of historical events is documented well.But when you look at something called \\"The Planets\\" or study the solar system--of course, the primary selling point comes from the visuals. This documentary series gives you a veritable feast for your eyes thanks to the available technology to unlock space\'s deep mysteries. History, science, technology, personal triumph, and even talk of extraterrestrials--it\'s all here. Engaging and informative, this is an easy recommendation for anyone even remotely interested in the topic. But even if you aren\'t a space enthusiast, there is much to learn from this presentation and much to be entertained by. However, if you already own the series in an earlier DVD incarnation--I would not opt for a repurchase. This is NOT loaded with new bonus features or added content which is a shame really. But, I suppose, with advances in the last twelve years--it might just be easier to come up with an entirely new and updated series. Now there\'s an idea!

So what more could you wan\'t? Well...a little more, maybe. I recently watched a documentary called \\"Roving Mars\\" - which chronicles the missions of two robotic probes sent there. RM is a perfect example of a fantastic documentary for several reasons: The narrative is well written and inspiring, the narrator(s) are great, the computer-generated graphics are absolutely mind-blowing (and spot-on accurate in every detail BTW), and the score written for the film works with it to really captivate and move you. Unfortunately, all of the things I just mentioned are a tad bit lacking in \\"The Planets.\\" The narrative is pretty much \\"just the facts\\" - which are good facts, to be sure. Still, the narrative reminds me of the type heard in those 60\'s and 70\'s movies shown in grade school (I\'m 48). As far as the narrator, she comes across as simply someone hired to read an informative script (there are other, more ispired \\"talking heads\\" throughout). The graphics vary from great down to slightly \\"dated.\\" Not to shabby, but nothing compared to the stuff offered in \\"Roving Mars\\" (if you\'re into asronomy and haven\'t seen RM, trust me, you need to pick it up). I guess I was just hoping to have the kind of documentary I would want to watch repeatedly, and for me that says it all. I have quite a few space documentaries, such as RM, Nova\'s \\"To the Moon,\\" and David Sington\'s \\"In the Shadow of the Moon\\" to name a few, and I enjoy watching those again and again. Once I was done with \\"The Planets\\" however, I had the feeling it might be a while before I watched it again. But hey, I\'m a tough critic and most people will likely enjoy this just fine.

Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes.

The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there\'s no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels\' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they\'re studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting.

However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson\'s catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed\'s new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest.

For example, there are episodes centering on The Wheat Field (Gettysburg), The Sunken Road (Antietam), The Hornet\'s Nest (Shiloh), and the futile Union charges at Cold Harbor. Going even deeper, each scenario centers on a particular unit or brigade (both Union and Confederate) - with particular attention to a key colonel, or Brigade commander, or a Private soldier - that fought in these particular areas of the battlefields. By doing this, the viewer is placed in the shoes of the rank and file and is given a pretty good sense of the desperate figting that ocurred and what these men were experiencing.The one \\"negative\\" I have to mention regarding these presentations is that the producers clearly could not amass the necessary body count of reenactors to accurately portray the numbers of troops involved. For example, in The Gettyburg \\"Wheat Field\\" episode, you see a small platoon of Union troops advancing across the field, where they were depicting an entire regiment or brigade. Fighting would be over in a few seconds with such a paltry command taking part in such an attack. So, even though these productions are excellent, the number of troops represented is far from accurate... almost ludicrous.I have not heard of or seen any new episodes of Civil War Combat in a long while. I\'d like to see more episodes in the future. Some scenarios I can think of that I wish were covered originally in the series would be \\"Gettysburg - McPherson\'s Ridge\\" focusing on the Union 1st Corps\' (with particular focus on The Iron Brigade) defense of the ridge on July 1st. Also, \\"Antietam - The Cornfield\\" focusing on - again - either the Iron Brigade\'s clash with the 1st Texas, or one of the other many regiments that took control and/or lost control of that sector of the battlefield.Definitely worth adding to your Civil War DVD collection - whether you\'re an old Civil War \\"buff\\", or a fledgling \\"buff\\".

The re-enactments are dramatic and very realistic in recreating the most important events of these battles, sometimes using what appears to be thousands of participants, dozens of canons, and in some cases men are thrown into the air from explosions nearby, doing somersaults and what not, making me wonder if some of the re-enactors had stunt man abilities. I found these recreations of several of the most important battles very informative and enjoyable to watch, I just wish there was a set where you could get all of the battles.

I disagree about the critics in purpose of the suspense, because in the original book the narrative is introspective in extreme, because it cames from a diary of a person connected to the original investigation and Poirot is cited in the third person, almost like the writer of the diary sometimes forgets what the peculiar little belgian was up to do! The movie adaptation was in my opinion the best approach possible, a compromise in keeping the secret of the murderer and a more dinamic rule for M.Poirot. And for me it was not a disappointment! About \\"Lord Edgware dies\\", the splendid and astounding performance of the actress that plays Jane Wilkinson (Helen Grace) steals the shine even of Mr.Suchet. It is magnificent! But there is a misinformation in the packet of the DVD. In the inlet they informed that BOTH the movies had closed-captions, but, to be truthful, only the Murder of Roger Ackroyd had these closed-captions, Lord Edgware did not! A lapse that must be clarified because many of the buyers in Amazon.com have hearing problems or, like me, relies in the closed-captions to not lose words because , with a misunderstanding , many interesting aspects of the movie were lost. For example, only reading the critics I finally understood why Hasting returned from Argentina, because of his wife\'s death (I lost this piece of information because they were speaking in \\"sotto voce\\" and I misunderstood!) Even more because in the books Bella did not die until Curtain (the last book of Poirot)when Hasting was already an old man with four children! The poetic license was completely lost for me. And I think many other things would be lost if Helen Grace , the actress who plays Ms.Wilkinson were not as good as she is.

Yet, strangely, except for his portrayal by Albert Finney in the star-studded movie version of \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" for a long time, there did not seem to be an actor who could convincingly bring to life the clever, dignified little Belgian with his unmistakable egg-shaped head, always perched a little on one side, his stiff, military, slightly upward-twisted moustache, and his excessively neat attire, which had reached the point that \\"a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet,\\" as Agatha Christie introduced him through his friend Captain Hastings\'s voice in their and her own very first adventure, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" (1920). But leave it to British TV to finally find the perfect Poirot in David Suchet, who after having had the dubious honor of playing a rather dumbly arrogant version of Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Japp in some of the 1980s\' movies starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot, was now finally allowed to move center stage.And the match is spot-on, not only physically but also, and most importantly, in terms of personality. Suchet shares Poirot\'s inclination towards pedantry: \\"I like things to be symmetrical ... If I put two things on the mantelpiece, they have to be exactly evenly spaced,\\" he once said in an interview, comparing his real-life persona to that of Poirot, but adding that unlike his on-screen alter ego, \\"I don\'t need the same sized eggs for breakfast!\\" Although previously not interested in mysteries, his habitually meticulous research allowed him to quickly become intimately familiar with Christie\'s Belgian sleuth and the workings of his little gray cells - and to slip so much into Poirot\'s skin that I, for one, can no longer pick up a Poirot book without instantly hearing Suchet\'s voice as that of the great little detective.This collection contains feature-length dramatizations of two mysteries.  As usual, Philip Jackson stars as a rather sturdy, down-to-earth incarnation of Chief Inspector Japp, Pauline Moran is Poirot\'s epitome of a secretary, Miss Lemon; and Hugh Fraser takes on the role of Captain Hastings, whom the screenplays, unfortunately, make come across as more of a well-educated but vacuous gentleman than do the novels narrated from his point of view, such as \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" and \\"Lord Edgware Dies.\\" (And this although the same station, ITV, did so well in debumblifying Sherlock Holmes\'s friend and chronicler Dr. Watson!)\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" (1926) is one of the most remarkable entries in all of Christie\'s collection, not least because of its completely unexpected turntable conclusion. This version moves the story towards the end of Poirot\'s career to better explain his retirement to King\'s Abbot, an archetypal English village like those that later became so crucial to Christie\'s Miss Marple mysteries (the first of which, \\"Muder at the Vicarage,\\" dates from 1930). Roger Ackroyd is an industrialist, the richest man around and \\"more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire could really be,\\" as village doctor James Sheppard describes him in the novel. When he is found murdered, Poirot steps out of his retirement to investigate his death - and its connection to that of Ackroyd\'s friend, the recently widowed Mrs. Ferrars.In \\"Lord Edgware Dies\\" (a/k/a \\"Thirteen at Dinner,\\" 1933), Poirot is asked to intervene on behalf of beautiful young actress Jane Wilkinson, Lady Edgware by marriage, who now seeks her husband\'s consent to a divorce. When shortly thereafter Lord Edgware is found murdered, Lady Edgware is Inspector Japp\'s obvious suspect. Rightly so? Poirot, somewhat dazzled by the Lady, is not sure - and unfortunately, his little gray cells do not work quickly enough to prevent a second murder, that of American actress Carlotta Adams, and even a third one, of a young playwright.Also recommended:The Mysterious Affair at Styles: Hercule Poirot\'s First CaseThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)Agatha Christie: Five Complete Hercule Poirot Novels - Murder on the Orient Express / Thirteen at Dinner / The ABC Murders / Cards on the Table / Death on the NilePoirot in the Orient (Hercule Poirot)Hercule Poirot\'s CasebookAgatha Christie\'s Poirot - The Classic CollectionAgatha Christie\'s Poirot - The Classic Collection, Vol. 2Agatha Christie\'s Murder on the Orient ExpressDeath on the Nile", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Poirot in Perfection.", "unixReviewTime": 1098835200, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2004"}\n',

I personally appreciated the differences between this season and the other five, as I feel like there was more emotional depth to this season, especially since as fans we have grown to know the characters intimately by this point, and we can truly appreciate how they each deal with the darker aspects of life. I think it\'s important to see how the characters deal with life in the bad times as well as the good, and I appreciated how the producers were not afraid to explore that side of their lives.My only disappointment with this season is the finale, as I feel the ending was a bit anti-climatic. The last episode wasn\'t terrible, but I just felt like so much had happened throughout the season that the series needed to go out with a bigger bang. I felt like the wedding at the end was a bit rushed and that the last episode definitely would have been better as double episode.All in all though, this season is a must-have for any fan!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Season Six: Unique but memorable", "unixReviewTime": 1300492800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2011"}\n',

I\'m not sure whether that\'s because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn\'t seen in many years.This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were \\"upstairs\\" dressing rooms for the cast and \\"downstairs\\".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the \\"upstairs\\" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!Then there is the spinoff series, \\"Thomas and Sarah\\", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as \\"Up Down\\" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E; obviously didn\'t lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it\'s a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of \\"digital dither\\" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast\'s collection.One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E; will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.Until then -- \\"look sharp,\\" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Greatest Drama Series Ever?", "unixReviewTime": 1253664000, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2009"}\n',

It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today\'s miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I\'d recommend this set of DVD\'s because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I\'d missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.I was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from \\"Punch\\" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.Some of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians\' strike in the early 70\'s. It doesn\'t actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can\'t see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn\'t detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it\'s adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70\'s and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.The extras are lavish:Extras:5-part documentary: The Making of Upstairs Downstairs24 episode commentariesUpstairs, Downstairs Remembered - with Gareth Hunt (51:50)Russell Harty Goes Upstairs Downstairs (30:00)Sandy\'s Last Stand with composer Alexander Faris (13:15)Simon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy in Conversation (22:50)\\"Russell Harty Plus\\" Interview with Gordon Jackson (6:40)\\"Russell Harty Plus\\" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15)\\"Russell Harty Plus\\" Interview with Angela Baddeley (9:40)Alternate version of Episode 1 \\"On Trial\\"Essay by star and co-creator Jean MarshIt\'s nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras.

Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.Upstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.This megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.  The megaset also contains a spin off of the series, Thomas and Sarah, based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165.  Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not, in my opinion, deserve to be grouped with it.

Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable\'s A&E; channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived \\"downstairs\\" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.\\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in \\"North and South\\" and currently starring in \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\".This beautiful box set contains 21 DVD\'s featuring all the show\'s 68 episodes and has a plethora of extras that include over 25 hours of never-before-seen footage!

It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.British actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.The household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family\'s preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie\'s death, management of the household falls to James\'s new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie\'s niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.The downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her \\"place\\" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants\' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).Interestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley\'s portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin\'s performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson\'s comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.The 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king\'s visit to 165 Eaton Place.Many viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians\' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth\'s suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy\'s secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new Upstairs Downstairs (2010-2012).  But the program\'s real heir is Downton Abbey (2010-  ).  Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman\'s side of the family.  Both Richard (U/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard\'s children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.This 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) \\"Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs\\" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) \\"Upstairs Downstairs Remembered\\" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In \\"Sandy\'s Last Stand\\" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the \\"upstairs\\" theme and the \\"downstairs\\" theme (\\"What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?\\").  This includes performances of both the original 4/4 and the more familiar 3/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.Upstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.By informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.Christopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as \\"the sort of series that doesn\'t come along more than once in a lifetime.\\"  Few would disagree.[NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.  Needless to say, be careful not to damage any other surfaces of a CD! ]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Best Dramas of All Time", "unixReviewTime": 1381363200, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2013"}\n',

Otherwise this is sheer kick-ass movie set of my favorite comedy director of all time (along David Zucker), Mel Brooks.Here are my given thoughts of the eight movies presented in this set:Blazing Saddles-10/10 One of my all-time favorite comedies, this one literally pokes fun at all the early Western movies we\'ve seen. A recently hired black sheriff tries to protect the peaceful town of Rock Ridge from certain troubles, most of which come from Attorney General Hedy Lamarr (\\"That\'s Hedley!\\") trying to destroy the town and build a railroad across the area.High Anxiety-9/10 A hilarious sendup to the Hitchcock stories, this one shows Dr. Richard A. Thorndyke, a psychiatrist with an huge fear of heights, become head of a pyschiatric institute, and realizes that he\'s dealing with a much bigger fear than his own.History of the World, Part I-8/10 Hilarious. This one is a ragbag of sketches, showing the timeline from the evolution of men to the Roman Era, to Spanish Catholic conversion to the French Revolution, all shown Brooks style. The Spanish Inquisition song, is a real hoot.Robin Hood: Men In Tights-7/10 Not Brooks\'s best, but still quite enjoyable. It\'s basically a parody on Robin Hood, which its jokes hit more than miss.Silent Movie-8/10 First time I\'ve seen it, and I like it. The title here explains it all: A silent movie about a crew of moviemakers making a silent movie for the Big Studios before the company Engulf and Devour takes over the studio. A simple plot, but still lots of fun.The Twelve Chairs-7/10 Even the most underrated Brooks film has some appeal, because despite of the lack of laughs, its storyline with a twist ending brings it home. Russian clerk Ippolit (Ron Moody) tries to find his mother\'s fortune stored in the cushion of one of the 12 dining room chairs before Rev. Fyodor (Dom DeLuise) finds it for himself. Fyodor brings most of the laughs of this whole movie with his maniacal character and hilarious dialogue.To Be Or Not To Be-10/10 A hilarious adaption of the old WWII story, as a Polish actor and his wife try to save themselves and the other actors of their theatre from Nazism cropping all over Poland.Young Frankenstein-10/10 Great sendup to Frankenstein. Peter Boyle plays an excellent monster, but the best preformance comes from Gene Wilder as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, who gains the inheritance of his father and takes the science of ressurrecting a being onto himself.Despite the double dipping of Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, the majority of this set is classic.

That would have made this collection a must have. I have always considered &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; as the best comedy of all time followed by History of the World Part 1.

The film looks extremely good but if you already have these classic films, I\'d suggest waiting for these to be released individually.Fans of Brooks will be buying this for the previously unreleased films \\"Silent Movie\\", \\"Robin Hood:Men in Tights\\", \\"To Be or Not to Be\\" (which Brooks didn\'t direct but stars in) and \\"High Anxiety\\". All these films look pretty good here (although \\"The Twelve Chairs\\" is probably going to be of the least interest to fans that grew up on Brooks other classic films). \\"Robin Hood\\" comes with an featurette produced for HBO on the film. Most of the others come only with theatrical trailer(s). \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" comes with a short featurette and some profiles of Brooks, the late Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. Clearly they weren\'t produced for the DVD but must be some sort of promotional bits for another format (you\'re guess is as good as mine)possibly for an Electtronic Press Book.If you have problems with any of the discs you can contact Fox at their customer service phone number 1-888-223-2FOX.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good set but I\'d wait for the individual releases--phone # for Fox Cust.

Such a refreshing contrast to the Hollywood  stuff so far removed from naturalistic dialogue it has little to do with  reality.I always considered the soap opera Eastenders to be  worthless...kind of weird that the same kind of working class Londoners can  be depicted with such depth and power as Nil By Mouth has.Finally,  the psychology behind Ray (Winstone) is delved into to the extent that this  brutal guy retains humanity (unlike the Hollywood counterpart which would  be a mindlessly cruel non-human monster).

Youssef \\"surfur\\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "by Dane Youssef\\"Nil By Mouth\\" is the very first film written and directed by the great Gary Oldman, a seasoned veteran actor who has still yet to give a bad performance. Oldman grew up in the poorest ghetto of South London, where this film takes place.And while this movie has been rumored and believed to be a semi-autobiography of Oldman\'s childhood and family (who wouldn\'t watch this movie and believe so?), Oldman himself has said that this is not him or his family.Hey, I believe him. Although he grew up in this environment, he was not directly in the line of fire, if you follow me.The film sets it\'s sights on a South London family that defines the term \\"domestic unrest.\\" A woman, her husband, daughter, brother, their mother and grandmother. As well as the people outside their family who they are connected to.\\"Nil By Mouth\\" represents many of the other families in South London, not Oldman\'s. The colorful cockney ways of the Great Britain. But more than anything, it\'s problem of casual brutal urban violence.We\'ve seen many abusive types in movies--usually one-dimensional and sanitized. But \\"Nil By Mouth\\" refuses to white-wash. The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood star-vehicle allows this to be a real film-going experience.This movie wishes to illuminate. Not entertain or delude. This is \\"slice-of-life,\\" not escapist fantasy. I\'ve told members of my family about it and they\'ve given very mixed reactions. My father and sister disliked the dime-store production values and no-name actors. They asked me why I would rent such a bitter and hateful film. My mother says she has spent her life shunning this type of humanity and lives as if it does not really exist.\\"The Way Of The Ostrich.\\"This is one of those frightening on-screen performances in recent memory. Ray Winstone deserves high praise and immortalization for his acting here in the role of Ray. He seems to be one of those unsavory, brutal characters in movies that stay with us. Like Hannibal Lecter in \\"Silence Of The Lambs,\\" Like Dennis Hopper in \\"Blue Velvet,\\" Like Norman Bates in \\"Psycho,\\" this performance haunts us like a ghost. The scorned ghost of a murderer...There is a cringing moment in which Ray answers his wife\'s question as to why: \\"I do it because I love you.\\" We cringe because his answer feels more familiar and common than it should.Ray is not merely an abusive drunk; he is a horrible bastard, always prone to violent outbursts. When his wife hangs out with a casual male acquaintance, he suspects that she may be having an affair and damn near kills her.Ray Winstone delivers a powerhouse performance in the role of Ray, a working-class man who loves his family, especially his daughter. But this man has demons. Demons that are so numerous and deep, they cannot be repressed. He can be a likeable, laid-back guy, like everyone else.But we see that without serious provocation, he instantly becomes raving and homicidal. A side that most movies (and people) tend to shy away from. He will make your blood run cold and near the end, make you cry.Kathy Burke, best known for her role on \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" takes an enthralling dramatic turns as Valerie, Ray\'s wife who\'s sole purpose seems to be to keep the family strung together while putting up with her husband\'s monstrous outbursts, almost sadomasochistic ally. This is an unforgettable performance.Whenever there\'s someone like Ray, there\'s almost always someone like Mark. Mark is sort of a sidekick or cheerleader for Ray and his violently domestic antics. He seems to be something of a drama queen, hitching his trailer up to the pain in Ray\'s life. It perhaps gives him an excuse to explode and go ape-s**t the way he does. It\'s mentioned at one point that Mark himself was worked over by Ray\'s father---maybe this explains the tie that bond these two.Jamie Forman is effective as Ray\'s little right-hand man. Apparently, Forman himself is the son of a real-life legendary gangster in London.There are scenes where he shows the true symptoms of a violent criminal. I wonder... is the caustic streak of the father burning through the son? Jamie, unlike his old man has apparently chosen a more legal profession. Kudos for him.Is he just a great actor? Jamie may actually have some demons himself.And while Ray may be the black sheep of this family, all that really means is he\'s the blackest of the black. No one here is walking on water. Valerie smokes and drinks despite knowing full-well she\'s pregnant. No one around her really speaks up in protest about her indirect poisoning of her child.Valerie\'s little brother, Billy is a severe heroin addict. Despite the fact that he\'s occasionally allowed to sleep over at Ray and Valerie\'s, Ray even feeds him and gives him a banknote here and there, Billy steals a score of dope from their flat.You can only imagine how Ray takes to this. Billy is scorned, but although he is cast out, he still stays with his side of the family and even retaliates against Ray, stealing an irreplaceable family heirloom.After this, Billy is not really in trouble.He is all but dead.Billy is a severe junkie and spends a lot of time with his friends. And since Billy is a junkie, there\'s only one kind of clique of friends he can afford: more junkies.One of his pals, Danny is one of the movie\'s strangest characters. Danny is literally covered from head-to-toe with tattoos and body-piercing. He defines the term \\"body art.\\" His whole body is like a big collage explosion.But he\'s not the one-dimensional freak/weirdo/thug we\'d expect just by getting a quick glance at him. He shows compassion and even sweetness at time like all the other characters, even Ray.Nearly everyone drinks and smokes. Nearly everyone says \\"f**k\\" and \\"c**t\\" on a far more-than-regular basis. And their endless stream of profanity and brutal violent mistreatment of one another is like a sad testimony to how tragically pathetic they are.You can almost hear the violins playing on the soundtrack to each of their lives. They are the victims of their life, their family, their environment, each other and themselves.Oldman films using the now-traditional and all-too-common (but at the time, novel) hand-held camera technique and 16mm film, thus giving \\"Nil By Mouth\\" not the look of a polished, slick and lavish film, but raw, unkempt footage of very real life.The movie looks like a true documentary, the herky-jerky camerawork makes it look as if we\'re seeing everything from our own P.O.V. As if we\'re \\"there, in the heat of the moment.\\"And we can\'t help but think about the little five-year old daughter and the unborn second child of Ray and Val, how their parents impact will undoubtedly shape them. It is an endless, vicious cycle of evil that shows no signs of breaking. And it is running rampantly throughout the world.This is just one of those movies that... after it\'s over, you want to do something... something to make things better.LITTLE TRIVIAL NOTES ON \\"NIL BY MOUTH\\": Unless you\'re somewhere in the European climate or at least Australian, you\'d best hit \\"closed captioning\\" or \\"subtitles\\" if you want to understand so much as a damn line of dialouge. The thick cockney accents are almost indecipherable. They\'re so thick, you could choke on them. For me, it was almost like hearing morse code. The characters might as well have been speaking Chinese.SPECIAL NOTE: The title comes stems from a medical instruction in the hospital not to give a patient food or drink as they\'re about to go into surgery.

Power is to make people do things that they wouldn\'t do voluntarily, but do it anyway.  To convince them that what they must do is even their idea is absolute power, and this is what the film is about (and many other things).  Chad is a bad man, but the system which acomodates him is no better: it is in fact the source of the possibility of evil, if not the direct producer.  The deaf girl goes out at the same time with a hunk and with a boss, and doesn\'t have a problem with it.

Add a UFO, time travelers, an android, and a hot Japanese lady from the future.  Throw in all kinds of crazy subplots and alternate history, and you get one monster of a movie.  This may be my favorite Godzilla movie of all time.  Yes, there are some plot holes big enough for Godzilla himself to fall into, but who really cares that much about plot holes when you\'re talking about the king of the monsters?  Here\'s some of the story: time-travelers from earth\'s future arrive in Japan via a UFO to warn the government of Godzilla\'s imminent return to and total destruction of Japan.  But, they say, they have a plan to prevent that from happening.  Now we get into the alternate history stuff.  It turns out that a regular old dinosaur saved a company of Japanese soldiers from American soldiers in 1944; a nearby island was the site of an H-bomb test a few years later, and that good-hearted dinosaur mutated into Godzilla.  The time travelers, with the assistance of a writer, a scientist, and a lady from the Godzilla-detecting ESP Institute, travel back to 1944 and transfer the pre-radiated dinosaur to the bottom of the ocean.  The Japanese should already know by now never to trust aliens--this time they secretly leave behind three gremlin-like \\"pets.\\"  They return to the current earth time and discover that the three cute creatures, when subjected to the H-bomb test that would have created Godzilla a few years later, merged and turned into King Ghidorah.  Now, Godzilla is nowhere to be found (and should not really even exist--but does--in the minds of anyone except the people who went back in time) and King Ghidorah is attacking Japan.  Now, everyone wishes Godzilla were there to protect Japan.  The Japanese send a secret nuclear sub to try and turn the dinosaur into Godzilla by irradiating him with nuclear energy, only to find the big guy already awake (luckily, another nuclear sub had sunk in the exact same area some time before).  Now, the fight is on between Godzilla and King Ghidorah.  If you think the movie ends there, you are quite mistaken.  I won\'t try to describe the rest of the action, but I will say that it has some fantastic twists and turns.The special effects are really pretty incredible in these modern Godzilla movies.  King Ghidorah doesn\'t have his trademark roar in this one, but he has everything else a fierce three-headed flying monster needs to wreak havoc.  The battle scenes between the Americans and Japanese in 1944 are an added treat.  By this point in the history of Godzilla, it pays not to think too hard about things.  We already knew that none of the movies between the original Godzilla and Godzilla 1985 really happened, and now we get a real twist relating to Godzilla\'s birth.  As if that weren\'t enough, we get Godzilla created yet again in modern-day Japan.  I guess this means none of the movies before this one really happened.

To the left being an oft-seen shot of Godzilla shooting his breath at Mothra. The cover speaks for itself being just a well executed piece of graphics featuring the poster art as its base, especially for DVD\'s which are usually nothing spectacular in my book, so kudos for creating such a cool looking package. This said, the downside of this is the case does not snap closed. Most \'book\' style cases snap shut, but being that there\'s no other tray save for the disc tray to click into, this case will eventually weaken and not stay shut, so purchasers are advised to keep the paper band that rides on the outside of the case. And in this or RAIDS AGAIN, there is no booklet.PRINTS: The prints are decent and certainly a HUGE step above the Classic Media release from a few years back that many of us already have (bright yellow with Mothra superimposed in the middle). It doesn\'t hurt that these are in anamorphic widescreen which was a treat since the other was a 4x3 and a pain to watch on a widescreen TV for obvious reasons. Without a doubt, the print here could\'ve been cleaned up/repaired, but it is still quite nice to watch all points considered. For some reason, since it wasn\'t beaten over my head that these were going to be outstanding fresh-as-yesterday-prints, I\'m more than willing to not complain. It\'s also a Godzilla film, which deserve good treatment, but I\'m not going to expect a CASABLANCA or WIZARD OF OZ restoration.....at least in this lifetime.....especially if it wasn\'t such a focused point as was done with the GOJIRA release.....which when we got it, was kind of a mess. The JP version runs 88:36, and the US runs 88:07.EDIT: I feel compelled to add, before anyone screams at me for not recognizing these are \'restored\' prints, well....scratches, genral wear and jumps are still just that .....\'restored\' or not.......it\'s still not \'restored\' to the original condition. So there...;-)COMMENTARY: I hafta admit, between this and the RAIDS AGAIN commentaries, I\'ve had the most enjoyable experience with the \'medium\' (do commentaries count as a medium?). They are really informative, especially if you are not a full-on Godzilla academic like myself. It could be complained that they are oftimes dry and book read, but who else is gonna sit there for two hours and do this kind of stuff free-form? I enjoyed this commentary alot. The two hosts played off of each other quite well, and most importantly, they didn\'t come off as pretentious, though in a couple spots, the comments about the \'realism\' of the scenes involved was a teeeeeeeny bit of an enthusiastic stretch....lol. I like commentaries on the rare occasions I watch with them on, when they don\'t beat me over the head with how wonderful everything is on the screen. These two are a good example of this...enthused but not over the top (KING KONG \'33 commentary anyone?). They recognize the film\'s faults for what they are and the good points as well. A simple concept, but I\'ve turned off quite a few gushing commentaries because the commentators devolved into gushing fanboys.OVERALL: EXCELLENT RELEASE. This is defintiely a keeper and does not feel like a cheap stand-in like the original release of this title here in the US. That one always felt like it may as well have been a cheapie bootleg sitting on the shelf. This is finally the decent release I\'d been wanting.

It\'s actually a smart, well-put together movie, something that people who look down on Japanese monster movies as silly and stupid would never expect. And it is LOADS of fun.This film followed up quickly on the massive success of \\"King Kong vs. Godzilla.\\" The studio, Toho, wanted Godzilla to go up against another `name\' monster, and selected one of their own: the gigantic moth/caterpillar Mothra, who had starred the hit 1961 film &quot;Mothra.&quot; The story has Godzilla returning to wreck havoc on Japan (this is the last time for many years that Godzilla would be the unquestioned `bad guy\'), defying the military\'s numerous ingenious -- but ineffective -- attempts to stop him. The one hope for humanity lies in recruiting Mothra to take on the big lizard. But the people of Infant Island where Mothra lives are reluctant to help because two unscrupulous businessmen have captured Morthra\'s lost egg and turned it into a sideshow attraction. When they refuse to surrender the egg, it begins to look like Godzilla will get to have his way with Japan unopposed...The film is absolutely loaded with stunning effects and action sequences. Godzilla\'s initial rampage in Nagoya is a knock-out, with the Big-G smashing a radio tower and Nagoya castle to the ground (Haruo Nakajima, the actor inside the suit, does a wonderful performance in this scene). The Godzilla suit used in this movie, known as the \\"Mosu-Goji\\" to fans, is beautiful: sleek, evil, and extremely personable. The two confrontations between Godzilla and Mothra, the first time in moth form, the second time in caterpillar form, are the best monster fights in all of the G-movies. Effects wizard Eiji Tsubaraya finds creative ways to have the monsters tackle each other, and the music from Akira Ifukube just keeps building and building. The finale is as exciting as anything you\'ll see in a big effects film from any country.The human scenes are very effective as well, with good performances all around from actors like Kenji Sahara and Akira Takarada, regulars in monster movies. Director Ishiro Honda provides his customary humanitarian touch to the story, and he takes it with an appropriate level of seriousness. No doubt about it, Honda was a great director, and in his hands, giant monster movies could seem like more than just light entertainment.The version on this disc is the dubbed American version. The Japanese language version with subtitles is superior -- a five-star rating easily -- but has never been available on a home video format (someone should really do something about this!). However, this is probably the best dubbed version ever of a Godzilla film. The voice acting is quite good, and almost nothing has been changed or edited from the original. Actually, a scene has been added, involving a U.S. military ploy to attack Godzilla with newly developed missiles. (Guess how effective that is.) The only real trouble with the dubbing is that the characters sometimes refer to Mothra as \\"the Thing\\" and other times by its real name, which is pretty strange sounding.The disc has nothing in the way of real extras. Also, the advertised 5.1 stereo is a cheat: the producers of the disc added a few extra sound effects here and there for the back speakers -- such as when Godzilla is being electrified or when tanks are firing -- that sound tinny, awful, and unconnected to the actual film. Stick with the original mono option.Even dubbed, \\"Godzilla vs. Mothra\\" is a four-star film and a must for anyone who loves giant monsters or just wants to have a good time on a Saturday night with friends.

The often campy horror mixed in with rotten English dubbing is no longer a tough pill to swallow for me. Asinine plots with meandering writing roll right off my back when presented with a nice dose of Godzilla blowing up Japan.Yet \\"Godzilla Versus Mothra,\\" keeps such problems to a bare minimum. This movie needs to be viewed not simply by kaiju eiga fans, but by everyone. Its messages for humanity are still yet to be heeded, and as they say, \\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\\"The setting of \\"Godzilla Versus Mothra,\\" is Japan in 1964. Naturally, the effects of World War II were still being felt in Japan, with especially high tensions in regard to atomic weaponry. The story gets rolling when a giant egg washes ashore in Japan, prompting a news investigation. Unfortunately, before the investigation can truly get underway, a greedy entrepreneur snatches up the rights to the egg so that his boss and he can construct a theme park centered around it as its main attraction. Tensions increase between the news team and the wealthy exploitation masters when ridiculously small twin women from Monster Island demand that the egg be returned. Of course, money makes the world go round and nothing can be done to persuade the business men to relinquish the egg. Not even the timely appearance of Godzilla.Eventually, the news team goes to Monster Island, right off the coast of Japan, in order to plea for help against Godzilla. While reluctant at first, the denizens eventually agree to send Mothra to do battle with Godzilla, although such a deal only works as Mothra is eager to reclaim its egg.Mothra and Godzilla have an interesting relationship. No, it\'s not a sexual one, but their life stories are quite similar. Godzilla was born from the radiation of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of World War II, and Mothra was born from nuclear testing on Monster Island. This relationship seems to convey exactly the sides of good and evil: When dealing with unfortunate circumstance, will you aid people or will you destroy? Essentailly, thats what we\'re dealing with in terms of Mothra and Godzilla. Godzilla is the ultimate destroyer, and Mothra is the ultimate defender. Imagine things on a smaller scale, both idealogically and in terms of literal size, and you\'ll find a worthy comparison to our everyday life.Of course, there\'s also the typical Godzilla message of the dangers of atomic experimentation. Radiation does no good to the world as \\"Godzilla Versus Mothra,\\" tries despearately to convey. Buried beneath this, however, is an even more hopeful message of reincarnation and the generations to come: When Mothra first does battle with Godzilla, he fails to defeat the giant lizard and is killed. Mothra\'s egg hatches as a direct result of Mothra\'s death, as the twins explain earlier in the movie. Essentially, when Mothra dies he is reborn as the larvae from his egg. These larvae are eventually what defeat Godzilla. If you take things from a more theoritical perspective, \\"Godzilla Versus Mothra,\\" is conveying a hope for the younger generation to do away with the terrible power of atomic bombs, but such a hope can only be carried on through the knowledge of the older generation. \\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\\"Of course, the outer layer of this yolk is laden with delicious monster on monster action. Despite being made in the mid-1960\'s, \\"Godzilla Versus Mothra,\\" boasts some impressive fight sequences. Naturally, everything is absolutely basking in the thick cheese that is kaiju eiga, so such impressive fight sequences often involve a man in a rubber suit wildly stepping on toy tanks. Yet this cheese is to be expected. What isn\'t so expected are those deep, involving messages that manage to be delivered even admist poor English dubbing and a man in a giant lizard suit. My only real complaint with this movie is with the ridiculous inhabitants of Monster Island: Japanese people painted red adorned in stereotypical tribal gear, complete with cliche worship rituals. It\'s a shame that a movie that excels in every other facet as to sink so low during those points of the story. Still, glimpses of a cheesy story do not hinder Godzilla Versus Mothra from being perhaps the finest kaiju eiga ever created.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best kaiju eiga ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1125273600, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2005"}\n',

Only this time, he\'s up against a giant moth who\'s preventing him from attacking more civilians. In 1964, the Toho Company released the fourth movie in the Godzilla series, \\"Mothra vs. Godzilla.\\" Known in the United States as \\"Godzilla Vs. The Thing,\\" the film was a product of the celebrated creative team of Shinichi Sekizawa (screenplay), Ishiro Honda (human drama), and Eiji Tsuburaya (special effects). Mothra Vs. Godzlla is known by fans everywhere as \\"Godzilla\'s finest hour,\\" for its good sound effects, tone and script. It\'s also the most popular and memorable film in the franchise. Mothra Vs. Godzilla is widely considered to be the best of all the sequels. Watching it again after so many years, I find that statement to be very true. This is one of the best Godzilla movies out there. If you want to see Godzilla in his prime, then this is the movie you have watch; for it truly is his finest hour.After a giant typhoon hits Tokyo, a news reporter named Sakai and his photographer Junko take pictures of the damage. Later that same day, the local villagers discover a giant monster egg washed ashore on the beach. The villagers salvage it and scientists come to study the egg. No one knows whose egg it is and where it came from. While Sakai and Junko try to ask Professor Miura questions about the egg, an entrepreneur of Happy Enterprises named Kumayama scurries the scientists off and explains that he bought the egg from the local villagers. Instead of letting scientists study the egg, Kumayama wants to make it apart of a tourist attraction. Kumayama wants to make more cash by having customers pay to see the giant egg hatch. Sakai, Junko, and Professor Miura are disgusted by the idea and believe that Kumayama has no right to keep the egg. As Kumayama discusses the tourist attraction with his boss, they are visited by two tiny twin girls.The two girls explain that they are from Infant Island and that the egg belongs to a monster named Mothra. The twins later leave with nothing after pleading with the two men on giving the egg back. The twins then turn to the newspaper journalists for help, but still fail. Later, Sakai, Junko, and Professor Miura then go out testing for radioactivity in an industrial area. That\'s when Godzilla suddenly pops out of the beach (where he supposedly left off after his fight with King Kong) and begins to attack the surrounding cities. With very little hope that the military will defeat Godzilla, another reporter suggests that the friendly Mothra might be able to get rid of the monster. Sakai, Junko, and Professor Miura then head to infant island to warn the villagers that Mothra\'s egg might be in danger, resulting in a climatic battle between Mothra and Godzilla.This was one of the many Godzilla movies I remembered watching as a kid. Back then I was always fascinated with Godzilla, so I was pretty heart broken to see him defeated at the hands of Mothra\'s babies. I was young at the time, so I wasn\'t as into the story. I always figured that Godzilla was a good guy, so I was really ticked off when I first saw this movie. It wasn\'t until I got older that I realized Godzilla was the bad guy. In fact, the early movies presented Godzilla as a menace. A punishment for the sins of World War 2. A result from the fallout of a hydrogen bomb test. A giant fire breathing villain with a sweet tooth for destruction (alright you get the idea). The other monster in the movie, Mothra, is actually a nice creature. A sort of \\"love\\" monster if you will. This film marks the first appearance of Mothra in the Godzilla series. Mothra would later appear in many other Godzilla films.Mothra Vs. Godzilla is one of the key movies in the Godzilla franchise, due mostly to its popularity. It\'s one of my all time favorite monster movies. It has a great story, a good cast of characters and a great script. It\'s top notch compared to many other films in the series. If this isn\'t already in your collection then you should be ashamed of yourself. Mothra Vs. Godzilla is a must own for monster movie and Godzilla buffs alike. Much like the previous re-releases, Genius Products attached both the original Japanese-language and English-dubbed versions of the movie. As always, the Japanese cut of the movie is better (and less confusing). Once again it\'s not jam packed with bonus material, but there is a commentary track and \\"Akira Ifukube biography\\" featurette. If you\'re looking for a great monster movie then look no further.

For something so silly, it has a lot of deep adult themes in it that just made me love it, and without a doubt is why this film is so popular. As for the monster fight scenes themselves, they are beautifully staged and exciting as hell. This was also the last film in the original Godzilla series that has Godzilla himself portrayed as the bad guy. In all following films he is portrayed as the good guy, at least until the rebooted &#34;Godzilla 1985 (AKA: The Return of Godzilla)&#34;. This is a great film that has things in it for kids and adults, and for all monster fans in general. If you like monster films, then I highly recommend this one because it would be a shame not to have this in your home video collection.Highly Recommended!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The fourth Godzilla movie, and a damn good one too!", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}\n',

Hedges", "helpful": [31, 34], "reviewText": "\'Godzilla vs. Mothra\' is one of my favorite in the Godzilla series. It is still early enough (1964) to be serious, yet more decidedly less dark in tone than the original. In this one Godzilla is still a bad guy, and Mothra, a giant moth, is summoned from Monster Island with the help of two miniature singing muses and some natives. Ultimately Mothra almost overcomes Godzilla with some great rubber monster fights along the way (and all the toy airplanes, tanks, boats, etc., that comes with them), but it is a \'Lion King\' (or &quot;Circle of Life&quot;, if you prefer) moment as Mothra dies atop her egg, which is being coaxed to hatch by some very imaginative chanting. The two grubs that emerge from the egg are out for vengeance and taunt Godzilla with several wily maneuvers before cocooning him in silk and dumping him into the ocean. The sight of the two grubs swimming off into the sunset is particularly delicious for fans of the series.The movie is well made for the era, and I think the English dubbing is better than in most of the Godzilla films. Likewise the script is more mature than the bulk of the Godzilla series, which in general I like, although it becomes a bit preachy about the anti-nuclear stuff (Ishiro Honda is the greatest director of the Japanese monster movies, but subtlety is not one of his more admired filmmaking attributes.) The film does, however, serve its desired function as a comment on greed and avarice admirably.I recommend \'Godzilla vs. Mothra\' highly, and no fan of Japanese cinema or monster movies should be without it.

Godzilla\'s rampages are fine, building toppling fun. The military fights back and the battle rages. As juvenile sci-fi epics go, this one is worth the price. The production values are better than usual. Chuckle-headed humor asserts itself, but plenty of Godzilla screen time keeps the action moving. The Mothra song, as vocalized by the twin fairies, is enshrined in fantasy film folklore. Watching the giant egg hatch is exciting, and recalls a similar scene in \\"Rodan.\\" Lightening flashes and thunder roars as cracks shoot across the egg\'s surface. The movie falters somewhat after two gigantic baby caterpillars take over for the first Mothra. Godzilla, who shrugged off rockets, bombs, and super-charged electrocution, has trouble with a rough-hewn silk shroud. Go figure. The Peanuts of the first Mothra flick portray the twin fairy girls. With all of the tiny women\'s mystery, one still lingers over their little faux-fur hats. The script doesn\'t explain the headgear. The special effects are unsophisticated by modern standards.

Special Edition is the same version that was released several years ago with a few additional features that was added to the Theatrical Version.  The Director\'s Cut contains additional parts of the movie that were Steven Spielberg intended to be in his movie.  For all of you confused don\'t worry the set comes with a high quality glossy timeline sheet with the extra parts that were added to each edition.

Richard Dreyfuss is one of the people who witnesses the UFO activity and from that point his life is changed.  Trying to discover what the meaning of this is.  Of course in the meantime his family and work life are completely disrupted.  Although this is just the beginning of this mysterious journey.Close Encounters is a magical movie to say the least.  The story is timeless and has been copied for many years without the same success.  The special effects have improved greatly over the years but movie still remains a classic.

He might be thought of as one of Hollywood\'s sacred cows, but not everything he\'s done has turned to gold. A regrettable example of that would be ...Batteries Not Included in 1987. He has done his share of stinkers as well, but Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even more so than E.T., in my opinion, is his crowning achievement. I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977). Trust me on this, this is one creepy film. Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night, giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO. Enough has been already said of the film that hasn\'t been already said. The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil\'s Tower in Wyoming, which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr). Devil\'s Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens. There are at least a couple of versions of this film. There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that\'s it. And then there\'s the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to. I have seen both versions, so I should know. When you\'re younger, you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the &quot;Greys&quot; that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens). When you\'re older, you\'ll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil\'s Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell\'s radio program). It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert, those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended). If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s, Close Encounters was truly that one movie.

Spielberg does his sci-fi epic the same way with this excellent release of the 1977 UFO Classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. When it was first released on video back in the early 80\'s it was the Special Edition version which was released to theaters in 1980 with new end footage with the interiors of the Mother Ship as well as other scenes edited out entirely and replaced with other scenes or alternate versions of other scenes. In fact, the only way to ever see the original was when it aired on TV as a movie and even then the two versions were combined to fill a 3 hour time slot. In the 1990\'s Laserdisc owners were the first to be able to own the original version thanks to Criterion Collection laserdiscs, except that the end credits were from the 1980 version. Then in 2001, the Collector\'s edition came out and it was more of a marriage of the two versions as it still eliminated key scenes from the original version, yet restored the originalending.  The Best part of this DVD set is that it pleases everyone. It has the original, complete with restored original 1977 end credits ( for the first time, The Special Edition, and the collector\'s edition and loads of special features including the extended teaser trailer for the first film, the trailer for the second and the advertising trailer for this ultimate colection edition.  The sound is presented in 5.1 Dolby and DTS format on all 3 discs. If you have the right stereo equipment, you could play the original in its original stereo sound format...but why. I\'m all for nostalgia but this is one of those movies where you need to have the subwoofer active, especially at the final scenes where the mother ship blows out the glass in the observation tower. The video quality is also superb. I can only imagine what this film sounds like and looks like on the BLU-RAY version also available and for about the same price as this set through online discount retailers.  A must for any Spieleberg fan.A little bit of trivia regarding both Star Wars and CE3K is that at the time of the release, both directors were reportedly in Hawaii, discussing the possibileity that their indiviual movies would flop  Both films were very succesful.

In the light of current special effects, it\'s showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.\'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.Unfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today\'s standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist\'s wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.This DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the &quot;new&quot; ending Columbia demanded for the &quot;Special Edition&quot; release in 1980.

Over the years, I have bought a CLV Criterion LD, another version on LD that is a terrible transfer, the standard DVD, and now the Blu-Ray.  I have one complaint.  I don\'t like any of Spielberg\'s cuts.  I believe this would be a better movie if EVERY scene was present except the entry into the ship, which is a meaningless light show and which Spielberg was forced to do against his better judgment.  Why not offer a version with all the cuts present and allow the owner to deselect the unwanted ones?  The CAV Criterion LD offered that feature a quarter-century ago but at a $130 premium.  The nature of the cuts is such that the movie should still flow well.  Hence, four stars instead of five.Is there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future \\"Apollo Creed,\\" which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.  However, Spielberg insists he didn\'t film the ship-in-the-desert scene until later, so I suppose he knows his own history.The extras disc is fascinating in that you see actors whose principle work fell to the cutting room floor.  You also get to witness some very bad movie making that fortunately never saw the light of day except here.  Yet, the cut scenes involving Roy in the field before his first contact, bad as they are, make his subsequent firing easier to understand.

The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.Perhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.

It also comes with a book full of bios on the actors and other people that worked on the film. Plenty of in-movie and behind-the-scene shots.

The 2001 DVD print is the &quot;Collector\'s Edition&quot;, and is not the same as the version you remember from the movie theater, cable television, or the laserdisc (depending on how you were first introduced to the film).As with Spielberg\'s later &quot;A.I.&quot; (also generally regarded as a misfire), this is a darker science-fiction fable than you\'d expect from the director.  The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish, in images and pictures if not so much in words.  The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky, or soaring over the Devil\'s Tower, haunted my dreams for years, just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age, long before I\'d watched the movie.  From that stand point &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is one of our most enduring films.Less well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss\'s role as Roy Neary, a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions.  Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film, Neary\'s marriage does\'t survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role), and we\'re left wondering if he\'ll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares?  The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he\'s pretty well alienated from his home to begin with.  Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him?  Will he ever return to Earth?  What does Spielberg mean by that U.S.S. Enterprise hanging in Roy\'s living room? :-)The film is rife with Spielberg\'s great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs, who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy\'s vehicle, lift up and fly *over* him, but he\'s too busy reading a map to notice).  The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least, in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of &quot;2001&quot;\'s last segment, if lacking in that earlier film\'s impact.The DVD transfer is, as others have said, a joy to watch.  The special features are a bit repetitive -- the making-of documentary is nearly as long as the movie -- and not all the footage from all the versions of the movie have been incorporated.Most Spielberg fans will not find this to be his most cohesive work.  Indeed, one day Spielberg may return to the picture yet again.

The whole movie wears a little smirk on it\'s face.  Masterfully done, Encounters has some simple but effective visual effects and a emotional and powerful soundtrack. The casting is good considering it was early in the careers of several of the people involved. Richard Dreyfuss plays his character perfectly. Roy Neary is a regular joe that suddenly is confronted with some life changing events that he can\'t understand. The messages that he is getting in his head confuse him all the more and Dreyfuss does a perfect job of illustrating that.  The supporting cast turns in good performances as well and really give the impression that you are watching a documentary rather than a work of fiction. The best parts of the movie in my opinion is when they are showing you clips from around the world of different UFO encounters and the research team finding evidence of an alien presence. When they\'re in the Mongolian desert and they find the freighter Cotopoxi. The same ship that was lost for real in the Bermuda Triangle. It still gives me chills.

But for some reason, not the main character\'s wife and kids.Some people see this movie as the escape of the main character from the drudgery of life on earth. But I think they have missed the film completely.Of the three versions of the film, I prefer the original. To explain why, let me begin simply by offering some snippets from the different edits, without explanation: In the original version, we are given a very meaningful cut going from a young child running after UFO\'s under the night sky, to the main character\'s music box playing, \'when you wish upon a star\' from the Disney version of Pinnochio (instead of going to the main character\'s own kid bugging him about doing his homework for him, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a meaningful cut going from the main character trying to explain what he saw to his wife, to his wife hiding newspaper clippings from her husband dealing with the same topic (instead of going to an old Navy ship left in the desert of Mongolia, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a seamless transition going from a team of scientists learning about a set of musical notes in India, to an attempt to translate them into hand signals, to an attempt to use them to contact the aliens by transmitting them by radio--to a young child successfully using the same notes on a toy xylophone.The theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary. It might also be called: \\"Man, Machine and the Northern lights.\\" Or even, \\"Pinnochio for Physics Majors.\\" Though \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" suits it well enough. First kind: sighting. Second kind: physical evidence. Third kind: contact. These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO\'s. Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth. The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology, seen as part of nature, like the northern lights; human beings and relationships, seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys. The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted. In terms of categorization, the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy, though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction. It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed. Superficially, it is about alien contact, but at a deeper level, it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life. In the end, it\'s more about human contact, than about alien contact.The film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together. At the summit: The hero, Roy Neary, and a young boy, Barry Guiler, having kindred spirits, are, so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family, one might even say providentially so. This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars. This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say, precisely, that it was Spielberg\'s main accomplishment in this film to convey it. Here Barry, a toddler, even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the \\"one take\\" kid! Though outwardly a movie about aliens, the visitors ultimately have, in this sense, the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom, Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid). It is, as it were, the antithesis of the premise for \\"Lost in Space,\\" of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe. If the child in you is dead, don\'t waste your time watching this film. If the adult in you is alive, be willing to see the film multiple times. It hangs together very well, but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why.Perhaps it even takes the multiple re-cuts. This film made a big impact on me when I first saw the original version; watching the re-cuts and analyzing why it had such an impact for me did go hand in hand. It is very interesting to now see side-by-side the three different versions of this film which Spielberg came out with reworking it over the years; I\'m happy to have the three provided together in this anniversary DVD. The line from the film which I made into the title of this review--spoken by one of Neary\'s sons--was actually not in the original cut. But it summarizes the original just as well as it does the other two versions (the \\"special edition\\" and the subsequent, \\"director\'s cut\\"), nonetheless. Spielberg followed his gut in this film, but he didn\'t check his brain at the door. Both have served him well. I see the original edition as the definitive one, and the two re-cuts as commentary and footnotes. Spielberg has referred to the director\'s cut as penultimate. I do not exclude the possibility of a new, ultimate version. Spielberg says that the original version suffered by being rushed due to studio pressures, and that the special edition was compromised by studio politics which required a \\"peek inside the mothership.\\" The director\'s cut, it seems to me (and others), was compromised by being made-for-tv. The second two editions do provide insight (and unused footage) into Spielberg\'s original vision; but I think the original cut still remains the best overall version to date.Two fascinating, very effective and related themes of the film are seeing the world as new, as if for the first time, and persevering aspirations to be faithful to truth amid being called into question by more conventional points of reference. Neary is led at points even to question his sanity himself; the audience is given enough reasons to question his sanity too, though are also provided with enough clues to leave open a positive final verdict. On the one hand, for example, Roy is not concerned merely with UFO sight seeing (even with his family)--he speaks in a number of places where he sees an importance to what he saw and the sharing of it with authorities--; on the other hand, when team of Lacombe (an international professional UFO investigator) first learns of the coordinates of the mountain where the aliens are planning a major visit, they wind up needlessly trashing some furniture (an expensive globe belonging to the county supervisor)--in other words, just what bad decisions will normal people make under extraordinary circumstances? The scenes where Neary inadvertently acts crazy in front of the neighbors--to gather material for building the large scale model mountain in his living room--were taken out from the special edition and restored in the director\'s cut; perhaps Spielberg worried the scenes put too much of the blame for the marriage breakup on Neary (and no, it\'s not like Neary has no flaws). In the special edition, in fact, Ronnie leaves the house before we see anything of the large scale mountain; we only see Neary carrying a garden hose and his youngest son protesting being taken by his mom into the car saying that \'dad needs some more help\'--with the car then proceeding to nearly run Neary over--; the version underscores: Ronnie deserted Neary. In any event, what Neary sacrifices to build the models, unexpectedly losing his family in the process, becomes very meaningful when he draws on this experience to climb the real thing--going against a government coverup story which evacuated the area to keep lay spectators away. Very intense scene, like a double jeopardy--and he is still not sure what he is going to find (nor is the audience). Beautifully shot. The last half hour of the film deserves its reputation, but the rest of the film is far from filler. Neary first noticed the real tower on TV in a news story covering a concocted \\"nerve gas\\" scare, just after his wife hung up him. I do think the mountain-climbing scene is helped by showing the prior havoc involved in building the large scale model mountain; I think Spielberg was right to restore it to the director\'s cut.Roy is vindicated at the end of the film in his conviction of the importance of his sighting--an importance which ultimately boils down, it seems to me, as the needed supplement for the limitations in a mechanical approach to communication. The limitations here are very beautifully portrayed in the final sequences by a \\"musical\\" conversation with the aliens, based on a five-tone sequence which humans first heard coming from the UFOs in India. Anticipating the importance of making the most of this for future communication, Lacombe makes use of a system for teaching music to the deaf to associate hand signals with the notes, which he teaches to the members of his team on the fly (in a nearly empty university auditorium). The notes were successfully imitated by radio to get in response (through radio telescopes) the coordinates of the mountain; they were also successfully used to initiate a whole musical conversation at the mountain itself (with a man at a keyboard and the mothership responding). But the hand signals were very nearly a case of being dressed up with no place to go. Computers were analyzing said musical conversation as it took place, searching for mathematical patterns (I imagine against a database), which the humans were doing their best to go along with, not by improvising, but by music theory. The computer found a pattern, took over the conversation, but it turned out to be incomplete. The computer could no longer respond to the mothership\'s prompts. The people were stumped too. (I don\'t fault Spielberg here for not telling us the formula the computer matched against the music, and why it sounded like music. Ever listen to mathematically generated fractal music? Some of it isn\'t bad, actually.) The point here was plainly that it was time for face to face contact. Lacombe was ready with his hand signals, but the aliens weren\'t too interested in them. They come out of the ship just romping and playing; they were looking for Roy. (An alien eventually does use the signals to wave goodbye--or was it hello / see you later?--to Lacombe, who had before waved his arms in exasperation when the aliens delayed responding to the musical tones.) To me explicitly having the theme of body language in the film made perfect sense. While you can\'t paint a real smile, you can study the difference between a real one and a posed one: they actually involve different facial muscles, even different neurological pathways. Neary\'s participation was necessarily spontaneous, and Lacombe was wise enough to understand its importance even from a more mechanical perspective: In its scientific defense, he refers to it as a \\"sociological event.\\" To put it another way: Lacombe was \\"left-brained,\\" Neary was \\"right-brained,\\" and the two approaches come together in the end to make a fully-blown encounter of the \\"third kind\\" with aliens who are \\"whole brained.\\"Neary and Barry do have the common failing of not being notably articulate. Neary even once quotes Barry in trying to describe the UFOs as \\"like an ice-cream cone\\"--adding only that its flavor was \\"orange\\" (and this being an improvement over his first attempt: \\"there was a red whoosh...\\"). He does improve considerably in comparing them to the aurora borealis, the northern lights--but only mispronouncing \\"borealis.\\" Jillian, more sensitive to the interpersonal side of things, does a better job too--and betraying herself a kindred spirit--when she spontaneously calls the visits in the sky \\"Halloween for grownups.\\" Eventually standing at the end of a line of volunteer astronauts arranged by Lacombe (and the only one not carrying a large duffle-bag), Neary is singled out and playfully caressed by the playmate friends which Barry had already made, solidifying, confirming and celebrating the new family bonds (the most moving moment of the film, with music from Neary\'s favorite movie, Pinnochio, playing spaced-style ala John Williams). On the whole a remarkable accomplishment, and Spielberg\'s masterpiece (produced, written and directed by him). Taking nothing away from \\"alien contact,\\" it still in its own way trumps it with a \\"family reunion.\\" This theme was to recur in E.T., but there alien contact becomes tongue-in-cheek and all-too-familiar; one might even say that E.T. is \\"CE3K for dummies.\\" Barry was no less interesting or precious than any alien; at one scene it is even made obvious that he looks a bit like his alien friends. The deep, personal contact of the kindred souls, even if visceral and inarticulate, is the real \\"encounter.\\" It was this simultaneous solidifying of earthly and extraterrestrial bonds which was really the most striking thing about the film. After welcoming Neary, and just after \\"waving\\" to Lacombe, the alien takes a moment to gaze upon the human crowd with such an expression of wonder and amazement, it is breathtaking; another inspiring, moving and thoughtful scene--as if Spielberg were holding up a mirror to the human race.\\"To the child the tree and the lamp post are as natural and as artificial as each other; or rather, neither of them are natural but both supernatural, for both are splendid and unexplained. The flower with which God crowns the one, and the flame with which Sam the lamplighter crowns the other, are equally of the gold of Fairy Tales[...]In the middle of the wildest fields the most rustic child is, ten to one, playing at steam engines. And the only spiritual or philosophical objection to steam engines is not that men pay for them or work at them or make them very ugly or even that men are killed by them, but merely that men do not play at them[...]The evil is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain[...]The wrong is not that engines are too much admired, but that they are not admired enough[...]The sin is not that engines are mechanical, but that men are mechanical.\\" -G. K. ChestertonCE3K is this passage put to film.***Some tidbits and trivia:There is a very awkward cut in the special edition (and in the director\'s cut) dealing with the Neary family, where Ronnie is first sitting with some of Roy\'s junk in her hands--and then, just moments later, when it cuts back to her--we see her holding her daughter instead. In the original edition, the scene of Ronnie holding her daughter is the first time we see her.I could never understand why the trucks secretly hauling scientific equipment are disguised as Piggly Wiggly and Baskin Robbins trucks. At that point they were still trying to figure out what cover story to get people out of the area with; maybe they were thinking of scaring them away with high cholesterol foods? I also find it hard to understand why there is a scene showing the volunteer astronauts wearing the special red suits as they go into a chartered bus. When sitting in what looks like a university auditorium, learning the hand signals, they are not wearing the red suits, but are singled out by having \\"special\\" seats off to the side. So why do they need the suits going into the bus in order to be visually singled out for the audience? The scene where the team members damage the expensive globe is a bit jolting, and seems a bit silly at the time; but I can imagine they were planning to bring it back from the get go not realizing how big it was until they got to the county supervisor\'s office where it was kept, and so, instead of going back to get the coordinates and paper, they stuck to the original idea of just bringing back the globe for everyone to see, and thus infamously dropped it to the floor and rolled it to their destination.I wouldn\'t touch the scene where the mothership, when seen for the first time, seems to rise over the mountain rather than descend from space; it is a very powerful visual symbolizing being both \\"on earth and among the stars\\"--and is just ambiguous enough to allow for the mothership merely \\"appearing\\" to rise while in fact traveling horizontally (relative to the ground at the tower)--an appearance perhaps due to the size of the ship and/or the curvature of the earth--it leaves the audience wondering a bit just what is going on--kind of like watching a moonrise. However, on very close scrutiny, it seems there were some minor flaws in the special effects concerning the mothership (perhaps due to a rushed editing job, which Spielberg admits): In certain scenes the mothership does not appear quite as big as other scenes require. Basically, in the shot of the rising/landing mothership, it should appear about 4x (at least 2x) as large if it is to be the \\"city in space\\" which the more closeup shots of the mothership (both outside the ship, as given by all versions, and inside, as given by the special edition) require. (I suspect a similar scene in \'Independence Day\' was closer to what Spielberg was technically going for.) Still, the visuals are remarkably effective and quite beautiful, and give a very memorable impression.***I\'ve given alot of analysis, but I don\'t think I\'ve spoiled anything.Watch the original version first, and enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\'aw, who wants to see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids\'", "unixReviewTime": 1100822400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2004"}\n',

I watched the original version with my 7-year-old. He was disappointed that the movie didn\'t show the inside of the mothership, so I showed him that scene from the 1980 re-release. He was underwhelmed, as were we all. CE3K, I think, was the last Spielberg movie that felt like real life.

The first release on DVD still had three scenes missing from the 1977 version that I saw on the theaters.  I did miss seeing the man with his family commenting on how far behind the aliens was in technology when it came to our highway systems.  I also miss Ray wife (Teri Carr) complaining that she was not going to get a job and Ray looking at the pillow and seeing the mountain shape in it.  The third scene was included with the outtakes.  It was the scene with Ray walking into the Electric Power Plant (his job) and talking to his co-workers.The first two scenes were not in the outtakes so the movie was missing something.  These two scenes were less than a minute each but they really stood out in the film.  I had to wait 30 years for this movie to be release the way I originally saw it in the theater in 1977.If you enjoy the 1980 re-release version of this film it is also in this package and so is the release 1997 DVD copy.
