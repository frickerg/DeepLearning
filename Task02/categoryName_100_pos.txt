A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \\"Elbow Room\\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \\"When He Looks at Me\\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \\"Time Stands Still\\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \\"This Land was Meant to be Free\\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \\"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \\"Cricket on the Hearth\\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming\'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, \'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio\'s Christmas, Rudolph\'s Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming\'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty\'s Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio\'s work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD\'s as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Thanksgiving Holiday fun from Rankin/Bass", "unixReviewTime": 1058140800, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2003"}\n',

It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn\'t?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena\'s laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma\'s roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It\'s Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that\'s how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can\'t help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star\'s 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You\'re  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you\'d expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It\'s  good, get it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just like St. Joan", "unixReviewTime": 965865600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2000"}\n',

Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances.

It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience\'s reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, \\"I love you too.\\" This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get, the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley, he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Enthralling", "unixReviewTime": 1105401600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2005"}\n',

On top of the excellent orchestral support from the Wiener Philharmoniker and Herbert von Karajan, there is a very strong cast of characters.  My personal favorite is Leporello, sung by Ferruccio Fulanetto.  His voice is strong, deep, and resonant.  All of the characters are not just singing but act well to make the DVD interesting to watch.  Samuel Ramey is excellent in the role of Don Giovanni.  He makes you sickened by the character and in the end when Don Giovanni is pulled down into hell, you feel like the the bad guy finally got what he was deserving.  In summary, the plot is captivating.  The performance truly is first rate with great performances by Kathleen Battle as Zerlina, Donna Anna, sung by Anna Tomawa-Sintow, and Donna Elvira, sung by Julia Varady.  Another great highlight is the trio sung by Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Don Ottavio.  Pure magic results when these three sing about bringing down the Don.

I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it\'s the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.

It\'s colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.

It is of higher quality: better stage, better costumes, etc.Also, there are great extra songs what the other does not have, such as:Trading Taps has a little &quot;showdown&quot; between three Irish dancers and two American black jazz dancers. It is very entertaining, humerous, and all around enjoyable. I really missed that in the first Riverdance. Oscail an Doras: One of my favorite Irish songs overall! It combines drums, singing and dancing. It also has a wonderful tune and great harmonies.Lift the Wings is a duet with a man and woman, and that really enhances the song.  It is beautiful.Freedom is much better. I did not like the Baptist choir they had. I have nothing against that style of music, but it definately did not fit with this show one bit. Now they have the regular singers performing, as well as a man with a really deep bass voice. Kind of like the man who sang &quot;Old Man River&quot; from Showboat.Firedance is not a duet. Maria Pages definately has enough charisma and presence to do a solo, and, IMHO, it is much better that way. Also, Michael Flately cannot do any suggestive petting.Besides having differences, this movie keeps many of the same winning features of the last one, such as the beautiful and talented Jean Butler (I swear she floats when she dances); the wonderful lady lead singer whose name I do not know, but has a hauntingly, achingly gorgeous voice; and the same great songs. Now I shall tell the best asset: Colin Dunne. Michael Flatley may think he is lord of the Dance, but Colin Dunne IS the dance. All one has to do is look at his face, and see the expression of pure bliss. The best thing about him is that, to him, the audience dissapears, which obviously does not happen with Michael Flatley. Flatley is a performer, and, while there is nothing wrong with that, that interferes with the actual show. I think the best way to compare the two is to look at how they stand after some dances.  After Reel Around the Sun, Flately stands straight up with his arms outstretched, obstructing the view of the dancers behind him. Dunne, after another song, stands with is head down, and hands pointing backwards towards them, drawing the viewer\'s gaze backwards. One more thing: I have seen it mentioned on other reviews that Dunne\'s chemistry with Jean Butler was not as good as Flatley\'s. I disagree; it is better. The only person Flatley has chemistry with is himself. Dunne and Butler have respect for eachother; that is obvious.In short, if you are getting one Riverdance, get this one. If you can get both, get both! For, as some people say, the camera is not always used to its full potential. However, it is hardly bothersome.

Madeline is a French schoolgirl who lives in a Catholic boarding-school with 11 other girls and their dorm-mother, er., nun, Ms. Chavel. The beginning shows how Madeline has to go through the pain of having her appendix taken out and then, when a new Spanish boy named Pepito comes in to live next door, chaos erupts. Some of the girls like Pepito, but Madeline doesn\'t, and it doesn\'t help any when she becomes the brunt of a few of his pranks either.Basically, it\'s war: Pepito vs. everyone else. After awhile, though, Madeline and Pepito figure out that it\'s much more fun to use the pranks they\'re been doing to each other on people they both don\'t like. However, the underlying issue is that Pepito is lonely because his parents never spend much time with him, and even though they hire an apperently \\"fun\\" new tutor, all isn\'t what it seems. Unknown trouble ensues when Ms. Chavel wants the girls to play with Pepito and his new \\"tutor\\", and keen Madeline begins to get wiff of a fishy plot. Everyone soon forgets about that, however, when Madeline finds a new dog, Genevieve, and Genevieve quickly becomes the whole boarding-school\'s pet.A negative blow to this positive surprise unfolds when the dorm\'s elderly, rich owner discovers the dog and takes her away, also declaring the news that he is planning to sell the school, news that Ms. Chavel has secretly known all along. Shocked but hardly intimidated, Madeline gets on her two feet and decides to save the school, reclaim Genevieve, and help Pepito out with his troubled family life once and for all. The exciting, thrilling ending just states that much clearly that you can never judge a book by it\'s cover, or in this case, a video by it\'s box.

She continues to be a more active and involved peasant girl than many past Zerlinas.  Her counterpart, Masetto, sung by Roberto Scaltriti, ingenuously offers the Don a Diet Coke.  He means no offense by this--he\'s simply a peasant working man, innocently offering an upper-class gentleman what he would give a fellow laborer.  And this is a good illustration of the way this performance accentuates the class differences put forth in this Mozart work.This production also emphasizes the incurably evil nature of a man who exploits others for his own sick motives.  Besides living to take advantage of all women, he is not nice to men either.  He is perfectly ready to sacrifice to an angry mob, the life of his ever-loyal buddy, Leporello.Some will be more than a bit offended when \\"The Don\\" gropes Zerlina, or when he humps a statue of the Madonna, but these actions really help to add to the portrayal of a sick, vicious, spoiled, elite society scion--a vile man who makes an eloquent argument for capital punishment.The music and singing are more than adequate;  the acting excellent.A weak spot might be the Commendatore\'s rather subdued singing--we are all used to  more commanding pronouncements from this ghostly statue.Though not my favorite Don Giovanni, this presents a starkly realistic take on a womanizer who is more a truly evil individual, rather than just the usual portrayal as a playing-around fun-loving Casanova.

While not as stunning musically or dramatically as his later works (La Forza, Otello), they are laden with memorable wonderful melodies \\"long long melodies,\\" as Verdi himself put it while describing the works of Bellini.  While heavily criticized by critics for the \\"um-pa-pa\\" beat employed more than generously, a lot of these melodies are actually very intricate and a careful listener can spot \\"Otello\\" in \\"Stiffelio\\" and \\"Falstaff\\" in \\"Un Giorno\\".  In the 70s, conductor Lamberto Gardelli brought a lot of these works back to life, casting exciting then-new stars, such as Carreras, Ricciarelli, Sass, Domingo, Norman, and Wixell.  Today, thanks to Fabio Luisi, we can hear more of these jams, most notably the overlooked \\"Jerusalem\\". But on video, these early operas are terribly neglected.  Aside from a wonderful \\"Simon Boccanegra\\" with Milnes, I can only name a couple more notable releases that made their way to DVD.This \\"I Lombardi\\" with Carreras and Dimitrova is currently the only version available on video, and it is in the VHS format.  The recording, thus, has many faults.  The image is sometimes blurry and the music sounds like a mono recording.  But the voices are almost incredibly good.  The young Carreras absolutely shines as Oronte, effectively managing heroic and dramatic aspects of the role that hints at Il Trovatore.  His range extended to almost 2.5 octaves and there wasn\'t any noticeable break in passagio - a must for bel canto and early to mid- Verdi operas.  Thanks to Hristo Brombardov two huge operatic stars of the late 20th century literally shook down the opera stages around the world - Ghena Dimitrova and Nicolai Ghiaurov.  Dramatic soprano Ghena Dimitrova possessed possibly the largest soprano voice in opera history.  This was not a voice that could be easily recorded, let alone matched on stage.  Surprisingly, Carreras manages to do just that - the super-loud crescendos are perfectly matched by the two singers; it\'s actually quite amazing how a lyric tenor could do that.  The perfect Giselda, both physically and vocally, though, would be Katia Ricciarelli, Carreras\'s long-time partner on both \\"I Lombardi\\" and \\"Jerusalem\\".  While Dimitrova\'s huge voice is a wonder to admire, IMHO the role of Giselda requires more subtlety and more gentle acting than she is able to muster.  Although Act 4 duet is indeed marvelous and melting in its beauty.The supporting cast consists of singers I haven\'t heard of before, but they do a very good job, particularly Silvano Carroli as a character aptly named Pagano (don\'t you just love the names of some characters in Verdi\'s operas of this period?  How about a \\"Luisa Miller\\" villain named Wurm?).The costumes are somewhat strange and too elaborate.  I would prefer more understated design of Oronte\'s garbs, especially considering Carreras\'s dashing good looks.  The sets are actually very good, I was able to make out most of the detail despite the relatively dark and sometimes \\"smudged\\" picture.I hope this video soon becomes available on DVD.  Several things for the engineers to watch out besides the picture would be a) Dimitrova\'s voice overwhelming the chorus more than once and causing major sound disturbances, b) the subtitles appear and disappear somewhat randomly.

If nothing else, its cinematography is vastly superior to this Covent Garden production, and its sound recording is better, too.  But for those of us who can\'t get too much Puccini, this production makes for an interesting exercise in compare and contrast.The two productions are similar in terms of the stature of the principal singers, the orchestra and chorus (which is very important in La Fanciulla), and the sets and costumes.  This Royal Opera production is, as far as I can tell, the only DVD opera that features Carol Neblett.  It\'s of interest, therefore, if only to see her portray Minnie, one of her signature roles.  Also interesting are some of the decisions the director made in this production.  It is played with very broad gestures -- Silvano Carroli, for example, plays Jack Rance as a swaggering Snidely Whiplash.  He and Neblett wrestle several times as he attempts to impose his affections on her and she resists.  Juan Pons and Mara Zampieri are restrained by comparison at La Scala. Placido Domingo plays Johnson/Ramirez in both productions, so you can see how his interpretation changes over time and in response to the different direction.  He too has toned it down a bit in the later production.Somewhat amusingly, this production is at times politically incorrect, as in Act 1 when it repeatedly has Indians stealing whiskey when the white man turns his back.

His loving, if quaint, portrait of the Wild West never fails to touch this Californian.  After all, WE romanticize our history, why shouldn\'t Puccini?  This charming Covent Garden production is the one I turn to for a cozy, old-fashioned treatment.  This is my fairy-tale Fanciulla and the \'92 Met my verismo version- both indispensable.  And now that I\'ve added the \'91 Scala I love it, too- Domingo giving and amazing and heartbreaking performance.I freely admit that my attention tends to focus on Domingo when watching any of these.  He is so perfect for this role- probably the most interesting character Puccini wrote for tenor.  Here, in his younger days, Domingo plays Ramirrez/Johnson with plenty of bravado and an ample dose of swagger.  This newly made bandit is arrogant and impetuous but also insecure and bitterly ashamed of his occupation, such as it is.  I think he desperately wants a way out but feels trapped.  When dragged onstage in Act III, he shows the terror of the hunted and the exhaustion of his condition but it\'s his own miserable guilt that really weighs him down.  He vehemently protests the false accusations yet he shrinks before the threats of the mob and almost seems to feel he rather deserves what\'s coming.This is perhaps my favorite 3rd Act, overall.  From the lugubrious opening chords it builds steady tension- one swell rising over another as it sweeps along.  I always feel I can almost see the chase as it is narrated.  And then the wonderful Sonora (Rawnsley) bursts in with such a lusty \\"E preso!\\" you can be sure Johnson can look for no mercy here!  I prefer the movement of the Covent chorus, too.  There is more milling around and groups coming and going whereas at the Met they mainly march up and down the street a couple times.  And while they use no outright violence in their assault upon Johnson their menacing hatred is palpable and the whole sequence effectively chilling.  And then we come to that lovely, closing farewell that always draws a contented sigh from me.  I feel this production best captures that beautiful nostalgia for the Sierras.

Obviously, my review will fall in a anti-Sellars rebels camp.Indisputably, with such a cast, the singing is superb.  My perennial favorite is Lorraine Hunt, and her \\"As with rosy steps the morn\\" to me is the pinnacle of this performance.  She has the same aria on a CD with Harry Bicket conducting; it is superb.  Dawn Upshaw is at her nadir, and David Daniels is phenomenal, too.But the staging, the production - why did they place this particular piece in modernity?  It is not justified neither aesthetically nor historically.  If the goal was to portray the sanctity of the Saint, then Ancient Rome gives much more opportunity to depict cruelty and brutality, with the benefit of being historically correct.  They could stage it at Coliseum, with poor Theodora in a cage under the arena, tied up as a wild beast, ready to be presented to the jeering unsympathetic crowd, desiring only \\"bread and circuses\\".  But apparently, Sellars\' imagination stalls and stops with a well-lubricated routine that sells, while a visit to the nearby church of Santo Stefano Rotondo, with its frescoes depicting in the most ghastly detail innumerable sufferings of martyrs would ignite any imagination.  However, I doubt that Sellars took much research into the subject, and why bother?  Art always resorts to the average artistic IQ of the contemporaneous epoch.Moreover, setting the plot in modern USA is wrong even ideologically.  How can it be explained that someone is condemned for her religious beliefs in this country in modernity?  Oh, it is so very bad and wrong; and looked like common nonsense.There are some unpleasant incongruities in this production, as deliberate stripping of the timid Dawn Upshaw, while her physique is not that attractive;  one can compare seductive scenes in Alcina DVD with Catherine Naglestad to get an idea of how such scenes can be successful; here they look rather pathetic and aesthetically awkward.It was stunning for me to see the disturbing similarity between this production and the recent Admeto from Halle, Handel\'s Festival, with this ubiquitous medical theme being thoroughly exploited there as well;  of course, Sellars takes credit for inventing this modern monstrosity, but it is sad that its influence seems to be so pervasive, perhaps due to sordid quasi-innovation of such representation; however, it is, as always, without any respect for the work and how the composer has envisioned it - certainly not like a piece of Puppet Theater with sugary cheap tear-jerking overtones, appealing to the modern audiences by scaling down the high-spirited idea.Regardless of any production, music-wise, it was to me one of the more tedious pieces of the Maestro di Halle;  his operas of adventure, as Rinaldo, Orlando, and 30+ others are so much more entertaining, including musically; of course I realize that this is an oratorio, but then Messiah is so much better.  Perhaps Handel wanted to repeat Messiah success 9 years earlier, in 1741;  but it did not work, it seems from the sheer fact of my own opinion :) and the statistics of the performance of both works.Thinking of Lorrain Hunt and her expressive genius, it was somewhat harrowing to hear and see her sing \\"Lord, in Thee each night and day we pray\\", here in 1996, only a few years before she departed untimely, despite her prayers, just as some extraordinary others, like Mozart, Pergolesi, etc;  yet curiously, Handel himself was awarded in every aspect of earthy delight, it seems, and is forever residing in Westminster Abbey :)Concluding, this is a classic example of a performance that is better to listen to than to watch.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Misfortune of virtue again.", "unixReviewTime": 1273449600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2010"}\n',

Director Peter Sellars moved the story George Frideric Handel\'s Oratorio Theodora from ancient Rome to modern day America and made an opera out of it. That was a bold move. An Oratorio is basically a choral concert with soloists. This is anything but. It worked though. The work is about oppression, its causes and the effect on people on both sides. The staging enhances the drama and themes are always clear.Valens\' actions make his nature obvious. He\'s a small and vindictive shell determined to beat the world into believing he\'s more. The actions of Septimius and Didymus make it clear their loyalty to their nation stands in contrast with their contempt for Valens\' cruelty. Theodora, Irene, and Didymus stand as people liberated by their choices. The music, the staging, and the people cast in their respective roles keep all this as clear as crystal. Frode Olsen\'s portrayal of the despot Valens is so concise that it was hard to rate his performance objectively. Tall, handsome and charismatic, he ends up being the perfect charlatan with no substance. His drunken tirade at the beginning of the second act is fabulous. Tenor Richard Croft excels as Septimius, the weaker willed of the two centurions. His portrayal is thought provoking to the point where it forces the viewer to question what he or she would do in a similar circumstance. Countertenor David Daniels is marvellous in the role of Didymus. His character is strong but gentle. It\'s something he conveys well, both with his body language and his singing. Dawn Upshaw is brilliant as Theodora. Like Didymus, her character is an example of the strongest being the most generous of spirit. Theodora is brave but though oppressed wishes harm to none. Dawn Upshaw has an inherently gentle quality in her voice. It suits this character well. She\'s a terrific actress as well, one who appears to feel everything she conveys. The one who stands above everyone else however is Lorraine Hunt. This lady is phenomenal. Her voice is full and strong in all ranges. Her \'mezzo\' notes are deep and broad. Her high notes soar across the heavens. Her passion is magnificent. She lives every note she sings. Her performance here stands as one of the best I\'ve seen in any genre. If her performance of \\"To Thee\\" at the beginning of Act III doesn\'t melt and rend your heart you haven\'t got one.Handel was proud of this work.  He felt it was his best. This performance of it makes a strong case for that sentiment. William Christie\'s tempi combine the best elements of the grace and strength in the music. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gives all that could be asked and more. Their playing is impeccable. The singing, as stated already, is fabulous.The only complaint with this DVD lies with its chapter breakdowns. The menu is limited. Scenes rather than individual numbers divide the work. There\'s also only one audio track. These are small complaints though. The odd chapter divisions are a small price to pay for this performance. The audio track (two channel Dolby) is exceptional. Everything is crystal clear. This truly is the next best thing to seeing it live.I first ran into \\"Theodora\\" about a dozen years ago. Like many I knew \\"Messiah\\" and some of the other favourites but knew nothing of the piece. An ad about a complete recording with a notation about this being Handel\'s \\"favourite of his works\\" caught my eye and after that a little voice wouldn\'t quit. It was the McGegan recording (which also featured Lorraine Hunt, that time as Theodora) and I bought it without having heard a note. It was a good decision. The beauty of this music is indescribable. Handel must have put every good idea he had and all his effort into it. \\"Messiah\\" may be the most famous (and that fame isn\'t unwarranted), but, for the best from Handel, this may be the place to go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Oratorio as Opera Seria: Bold, Brilliant and Beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1093737600, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2004"}\n',

Certainly it can be a gamble to invest in his visions. However, there is no such risk with his 1996 staging of Handel\'s \\"Theodora\\". Not only does he not disappoint, he creates an intensely creative and heartfelt modern-day update of what has to be one of the saddest stories about the power of faith in a world of bad governments. Now eight years have elapsed since this staging, and the theme resonates more than ever.The minimalist set acts as a subtle counterpoint to an astonishing cast. Really impressive is Lorraine Hunt, who sings in that burnished mezzo-soprano range that fits her role so well. What I appreciated most about her performance is that she got the drama of what was essentially an observational role without calling undue attention to her character. When you have five great voices competing for your attention, obviously that is not a minor accomplishment.  The real standout, however, is David Daniels. The countertenor voice is an acquired taste for many, but his full and rich voice will convert even the most jaded. He brings a melting, haunting quality to his performance from his first outstanding aria to the final heartbreaking ending where Sellars uses an almost clinical approach to the inevitable. It was obviously a star-making performance for Daniels, and he completely delivers the goods. The results are devastating.If you are a non-opera buff...if you are leery of stories with heavy Christian themes...if you are afraid of the 207-minute running time, fear not, as this is no depressing, fundamentalist history lesson marathon...they even sing in English!

It is one of the great works on DVD - to cut to the chase, buy it, buy it, buy it.Musically, it is superb;no performance, neither singers, nor chorus, nor conductor, nor orthestra is less than excellent.

I could be happy just watching their faces, so full of character and meaning and beauty are they.Let me rant a bit about Lieberson, she deserves it.  Her performance embodies a moral beauty, a virtue, I have otherwise seen only in Dame Janet Baker\'s performance of Orfeo; it is one of the great performances of anything: she has great lyric line, sings beautifully, acts beautiful, and in her ecstatic moments has a face I would like to gaze on while dying.Much credit, of course, must be given the director, Peter Sellars.  His staging, while a bit fussy in the first Roman scene, is acutely sensitive to each moment of the drama, and often achieves great intensity and/or beauty.  In particular, his staging of the Christian scenes marvelously dramatizes the movement of the holy spirit through human beings striving to fulfill their understanding of the will of God.A brief word about Handel\'s music here.

I purchased a three ballet boxed set of Tchaikovsky ballets, which included \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", \\"Swan Lake\\", and \\"The Nutcracker\\". I fell in love with Sleeping Beauty, by THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET.Sleeping Beauty  / Christine Walsh, Australian BalletIt stars Christine Walsh and David Ashmole. Since then I have been collecting all the ballet DVDs I can afford.Little did I know that in the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was the up and coming sensation of \\"Coppelia\\", Lisa Pavane and Greg Horsman. If you have that DVD, Lisa is the Fairy Godmother in the brown tutu. I could not identify Greg.I know my job as a reviewer is to inform you of what I think of \\"Coppelia\\" by the Australian Ballet, so I will get to the point. First of all, it is the most FUN ballet in existence. It is the happiest ballet that I have so far seen. I saw it live once many years ago in Nashville, Tennessee, so I knew the story and LOVED the music. One reviewer commenting on \\"Snow White\\" with music composed and conducted by Emilio Aragon from Spain, said that Aragon\'s music had only one theme and was repeated over and over throughout the entire ballet.Arag&oacute;n: Snow White (ballet)I did not agree (read my review on Snow White). The same could never be said about Coppelia because Leo Delibes gives us at least 31 distinctly different melodies, and most of them are so beautiful that words cannot describe them. The producers of this Coppelia were not happy with 31 melodies so they borrowed one from another Delibes ballet \\"Sylvia\\". The melody is the one used by the bridesmaids and groomsmen in their dance to honor the bride and groom Swanilda and Frans in the third act. It is so beautiful I do not blame them for adding it to Coppelia.Delibes: SylviaLisa Pavane is a sensational ballerina and her partner Greg Horsman is a sensational danseure. They both have a tremendous amount of dancing to do in this ballet, and most of it is fast tempo. It shows in the curtain calls as they are perspiring profusely. The costumes used in this ballet are fabulous (as they were in the Australian version of Sleeping Beauty) And the sets were also the best I\'ve seen both live and in the Royal Ballet production of Coppelia. Each act has a completely different set. The Coppelius workshop set puts the Royal Ballet\'s to shame. There is simply no comparison, and that goes for the animatons (dolls) too. You don\'t have to believe me, just buy this ballet and listen to the patrons of the Sydney Opera House go wild when the dolls come to life and go through their dance routines, especially the disjointed rag-doll. Colin Peasley is simply great as DR. Coppelius, the \\"mad\\" doll maker. Peasley is also a member of the governing body of the Australian Ballet Company.When I saw this ballet live so many years ago in Nashville, the promoters offered anyone who was not happy with the production, their money back.  I did NOT ask for my money back.

The police decide the murderer must have a record somewhere, they just have to search for a \\"harmless man\\" who has this personality. The gang leaders decide to watch the children.

There are very few films today that can even come close to capturing the brilliance that is captured within the frames that make up `M\', a harrowing story about a murderer of children who manages to elude the police but finds himself in the angry hands of the criminal underground.  `M\' (shortened from the original title `Eine Stadt Sucht Einen Morder\' which translates to `The Murderers are Among Us\') broke many boundaries and paved the way for the expressive filmmaking of today, but still it holds it\'s own as supremely better than most everything released today.`M\' tells us the story of Hans Beckert and the misery and panic he spread throughout a small German city.  As children come up missing and or dead parents and concerned citizens alike find themselves in disarray as the police continue to search for this killer of children with no real success and or advancements.  As the police too begin to panic in their faulted efforts they begin to weigh heavy on the German community which has some adverse effects on the criminals controlling the underground.  These criminals come together to try and better their own situation which leads them to conclude that the only way they will get the police off of their backs is if they catch and put an end to this horror of a man once and for all.There are so many facets to this film that make it one of the grandest of all time.  It sets a perfect mood for the subject at hand, never once straying from that eerie and heart stopping vibe that permeates the screen.  The film flows magically from one scene to the next, never chopping and or losing our interest.  The rich black and white film and grainy atmosphere only add weight to the already weighty subtext; and then there is the sublime inclusion of the tune `In the Hall of the Mountain King\', which is whistled by Beckert while he is on the prowl.  It is a simple detail, but that one detail is probably the most haunting facet to the entire film.And then, there is Peter Lorre.Peter Lorre has received much acclaim and attention for this gutsy role, tackling the first ever on screen serial killer, and rightfully so.  His fearless performance is one of the greatest of all time.  There is a scene where he is staring in the window of a toy store, watching a young girl in a mirror and his face bleeds forth with this wretched pain and confusion; utter torment eating away at his very soul.  He makes this man human, which was very gutsy especially at the time.  His final breakdown towards the end of the film where he tries to explain his horrible condition, his sickness if you will, is actually quite moving in his dire conviction and commitment to his performance.  It reminds me of the shivers one receives when witnessing Edward Norton\'s portrayal of Neo-Nazi Derek in `American History X\'; a horrible man yet so convincing in his plight you wind up sympathizing with the Devil.`M\' is not a film to be taken lightly.  There is so much power packed within this picture that one should be made aware of its affects on an individual.  `M\' captures almost all too well the true extensive deteriorating powers of panic and fear.  As the general public begins to wear down with the police\'s inability to capture this murderer they begin to turn on one another, ready and willing to condemn any man who comes within speaking distance of a child.  The police likewise resort to rash and overzealous methods in order to uncover this murderer, feeling pressured by the innocent public merely trying to safeguard their offspring.  The criminals too feel compelled to take matters into their own hands in an effort to rid their town of its eternal distress and all of this culminates into a melding pot of dread and misery.`M\' may be hard to stomach at times.  No, this is not a graphic film but it is haunting in that it manages to strike at the heart of the audience, seeping into their soul.  The aftereffects are as distressing as those brought on by the recent `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile\' (`4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\'); a film that brings out in us the human desire to correct all evils and save our loved ones from the exhausting touch of pain and suffering.  `M\' is a film that finds itself in your heart and soul and wrecks havoc on your inner being; ultimately becoming a part of you and thus never leaving your side.

Fritz Lang\'s M is, at parts, tremendously funny. At others, it is immensely disturbing and psychological. But always M holds us in it\'s grasp; riveting, gripping, and brilliant.One of the first films about a serial killer, released before that term had even become popular, M didn\'t just give us one of the most compelling and twisted villains in cinematic history, it makes us identify and perhaps even sympathize with him. The impact of M cannot be understated, as it gave us one of the Golden Age of Hollywood\'s greatest character actors: Peter Lorre (Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon), popularized police procedurals and serial killers in cinema, and influenced countless other famous filmmakers with it\'s brilliant expressionist cinematography and visual style.Though the plot is blindingly simple (A child-hunting serial killer holds Berlin in terror and paranoia. When the police\'s methods get increasingly desperate and dangerous for underground criminal bosses to sit easy, they send out their own men to apprehend the murderer. Finally, the killer is marked and followed...), M is a complex film that still resonates within our day and age, with it\'s subtle commentary on our modern society. It\'s final message (\\"Someone must watch over the children\\") is a little forceful, but Lang get\'s his message across with haunting effectiveness. I think this is a movie we need more than ever today.Of course, most praise should go to Peter Lorre, who before his role as baby-faced serial killer Hans Beckert was mainly known as a song-and-dance man. After? He was shot to international fame and became one of Hollywood\'s most sought after actors. The praise is hugely deserved. Lorre gets under your skin and stays there for a long, long time. As Beckert he is unbelievably creepy - Lorre\'s mirror scene will send chills up your spine, and the sight of his face illuminated by a flashlight like a deer in the headlights is unsettling on a psychological level. But it is in Lorre\'s electrifying final scene that he establishes himself as one of cinema\'s greatest actors. And this is his greatest performance. His final speech is one of the most compelling, disturbing, and gripping scenes I have scene in any cinema. Top marks for the true simmering intensity lying under that mask of pudgy innocence. This is one for the ages.I want to touch on just one more thing: the stunning visuals. You really shouldn\'t expect any less from Fritz Lang - this is the megalomaniacal genius that gave us cinema\'s first sci-fi - Metropolis.

Scenes and shots linger long in the mind after they are seen, and the cinematography (shadows, lights, and darks especially) is the kind that directors dream about in their sleep.

A classic, but still relevant today, M is a showcase for a peerless and haunting performance from Peter Lorre as one of cinema\'s most twisted and chilling villains, brilliant visuals, and with a sharp plot, dark humor, satire, and subtle social commentary...this is one of the GREATEST films in foreign cinema.

The commentary is well-done and stays on topic, and the video is so crisp and clear you can\'t believe it was filmed in 1931. It\'s interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can\'t help but see the difference.The murderer, artfully played by Peter Lorre, has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police, despite all of their efforts, are unable to catch him, mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then, the film shifts to two normally opposed groups - the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities, the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them, and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.In a particularly well-done part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released.

Fritz Lang\'s first \\"talkie\\" has been very well restored and although the picture quality is not perfect which would be unreasonable to expect of a 80-year film and the sound quality is also not perfect but in this case is not essential as the film works very well with Lang\'s direction and hence unique storytelling style making this is likeThe Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray] a few years earlier a film classic and another work of genius.  The rolling ball and the flying kite scenes for example \\"speaks\\" volumes and does more than tons of dialogue could do and if ever a film shows that a picture speaks a thousand words this one is it.Fritz Lang addresses another social ill here as he did in \\"Metropolis\\" but unlike that film the actual lesson is elusive.  The special features here are excellent and include an excellent interview conducted by director William Friedkin ofThe Exorcist (Extended Director\'s Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray] andThe French Connection (Two-Disc Collector\'s Edition)of Lang in which he explains his intention was to instruct adults to be much more mindful of their children and that there is no excuse for neglecting them as they are the future and how well we look after them will determine what kind of a future we will have.  This was so prophetic when you look at Germany not too long after with the Hitler youth that was so important for the Nazi party for example or how misguided youth can lead to tragic consequences when due to negligence parents allow unsavoury elements to replace them.  The parents blame the police, the various criminal elements, the actual psychopathic killer, how busy they are with work i.e. everyone but themselves for the deaths.  Lang even in a way tries to weaken the case for blaming the perpetrator who is portrayed as this killer who wants to be caught witness his letter to the police inexplicably leaving clues to aid in his capture and in his impassioned apologetic for himself in front of the mob which even evokes sympathy for him.  This was very enlightening as because of various producer interference and hence various alternate endings and cuts which can be seen in the English version also included in this set it became very hard to see this thesis resulting in many people talking about how this film was about compassion for the insane criminal, the abolition of capital punishment for the insane, how insane is insane enough, the hypocrisy in society of how the \\"low-life\\" are targeted and assumed of the horrible crime of child murder when the perpetrator stands among the more \\"respectable\\" at least in society\'s eyes, the comedy of \\"low-lifes\\" judging a \\"lower life\\" etc.These are just a few lessons one can draw from the movie without viewing the movie in full and hence in the way the director intended it to be and you get it here as complete and as well restored as can be to date but only in the original German version which is the best way to view this; turn on the English subtitles if you need to as the English version hasn\'t been restored and the ending has been changed and so doesn\'t flow as well and is a pale parody of the German version.  What the German mother says as the last line of the film is critical to the meaning and is totally lost in the English version which has an alternate ending.  The fact that a 110 minute film generates so many talking points and is still relevant today with violence in various forms against children still rampant with many people blaming various things and pointing to various reasons when perhaps the answer is just better vigilance and spending more time with them so that the evils of the world can\'t get at them is testament to the greatness of this film and of Fritz Lang.  Indeed this to me is the definition of a great film that transcends time and remains relevant and thought-provoking even rewarding many repeated viewings and it is really sad that we don\'t get enough of these types of films today and we have to settle for mindless crap like \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\", \\"Dumb & Dumber\\", \\"Legally Blonde\\", \\"Scream\\" etc.Great Criterion release, well restored but not perfect picture and sound quality, great extras and excellent film makes this an easy review.Very highly recommended!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lang\'s First \\"Talkie\\" Now Restored and On Blu-Ray!", "unixReviewTime": 1302825600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2011"}\n',

Directed by the great German director Fritz Lang in 1931 this is one film that will keep you on edge as the events unfold in the story. Starring Peter Lorre as the serial killer Hans Beckert this may well be Lorre\'s best acting performance and that says a lot considering what a great acting career he had. As for the director, Fritz Lang had a stellar career himself behind the camera. Best known for the silent classic \\"Metropolis\\", \\"M\\" (which would be Lang\'s first sound movie) might well be Lang\'s masterpiece. It is a story that looks both at the uncontrollable madness Beckert falls into to kill while at the same time looking at how the murders of young girls effect society as it deals with the horrors of the murders. That makes \\"M\\" just as much a psychological thriller as a suspense movie. There are certainly twists and turns to the film to. As the police become more frustrated in not being able to find any kind of evidence to show who the killer is while the public hounds them for results in capturing the murderer the criminal element in the city begin hunting for the killer as well. The police are leaving no stone unturned in their hunt for the unknown killer which includes busting up all the illegal activities the local gangsters are running in their quest to find this person. That of course is interfering with the gangsters profits so they decide to hunt for the killer too to bring him to their version of justice. The movie then becomes a race to see who can capture the killer first once both sides finally figure out who the unknown serial murderer is.To make this such a great experience to watch is the work that has gone into restoring the film to its original state. The transfer of the film onto DVD is outstanding. I have a copy of \\"M\\" on VHS tape that is about 20 to 25 years old. The picture on that is grainy and faded in places and there are parts to the movie that are missing. But with the work done to restore the movie thanks to todays technology the picture is clear, crisp and many of the missing parts of the film have been added again bringing better continuity to the story line.This is one suspense film I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is a fan of this genre of movie.

It\'s also in German and when movies that came out three years ago have been forgotten, this movie still thrives and frequently finds itself on a Great Movies list by some critic. In fact, the way I heard of it was through Roger Ebert\'s The Great Movies. \\"M\\" is a great movie. It\'s not, in my opinion, an entertaining film though. It\'s a great movie, because it\'s one of the first (if not the first) serial killer movie; It\'s got some good cinematography...From what I\'ve heard about previous releases of this film (both DVD and VHS), I think I got lucky with the copy I obtained. The subtitles are clear, the sound quality is good, and the picture is all-right. The picture is far from perfect, but it\'s watchable. In this film, Peter Lorre (you may remember him from Casablanca, among other things) plays the semi-main character Hans Beckert. I say semi-main character because he\'s the character that the entire film is built on, but he has a miraculously small amount of screen time when you get right down to it. Hans Beckert is a serial killer and it\'s hinted about that he\'s a pedophile. It also says he is on the back cover, so I assume that he is. If someone could go get Lorre from 1931 and bring him into the future, every Hollywood director making a film about a serial killer would cast him. He\'s such a bug-eyed, creepy looking dude he fits the part so well. In the beginning of the film, we hover above some kids as they play a game. This game is a typical children\'s game, but the words they chant are a little more sinister than you\'d expect. A few minutes later, one of the girls is kidnapped and killed. For the record, no murder is ever seen onscreen. You don\'t even get as far as seeing Beckert leading his victim off the screen and suddenly hearing screaming. Because of Beckert, the city is in turmoil. The police are desperately hunting the man down and so is the German underworld. Police raids are frequent and police are walking around so much, it\'s keeping other criminals from doing what they do best. The title \\"M\\" comes from a scene in the film where a man is following Beckert and is able to mark his jacket with the letter \\"M\\" (short for murderer) to follow him more easily. This is not a movie you\'d rent for enjoyment; It\'s a movie you should check out, so you can say you\'ve seen it. It\'s not a movie that will rub everybody the right way and it\'s certainly not the best film ever made, but it\'s ahead-of-it\'s-time cinematography and speeches (especially Lorre\'s at the end) make it worth it.GRADE: B-", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Picture Quality Sucks, Movie\'s Good", "unixReviewTime": 1159574400, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2006"}\n',

However, the Lang faniship overwhelmed my aversion to these crime films.  I think what keeps me back is the gore.  I think that depicted gore deadens your higher sensibilities.  By the way, I work in a hospital, so it is not squeamishness son my part.The key to this movie is Fritz Lang\'s incomparable eye.  He has the palace and artistic symmetry that would have made him a great Renaissance and Baroque artist.  Each scene is a masterpiece and a work of art.  This cinematography is a dying art in the film industry, focusing on computer generated gimmicks and machine gun profanity to carry the film along.  His style reminds us of Orson Welles, Gregg Toland, and Alfred Hitchcock.  Film is primarily visual, and Lang exploits this primary dimension of filmwork to its utmost.The black and white aspect to this film is powerful.  Admittedly, black and white originally was to due to the poor technology, but it has advantages that color lacks.  You feel shadows, and taste the darkness.  For example, in Lorre\'s first scene, you just see his silhouette in shadow whistling \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King.\\"  This creates an almost hysterical sense of suspense. You know someone is bad, but you don\'t see him.  He becomes a phantom menace of colossal proportions.  This film is almost a moving study of Ansel Adams gone psycho!This film, however, is not mere eye-candy, but it raises many ethical situations.

To hasten the capture of the murderer, the police clamp down tightly on local criminal activity, making business-as-usual activities nearly impossible for members of the city\'s organized-crime syndicate.  So in an effort to return the city to its previously permissive state of affairs, the local mobsters decide to hunt down the elusive homicidal pedophile themselves.This compelling study of a pedophilic serial killer and the public reaction to his odious crimes was decades ahead of its time in its treatment of psychological, political, and sociological themes.  The first \\"talkie\\" from pioneering auteur Fritz Lang--probably better known to fans of classic cinema as the director and artistic force behind 1927\'s groundbreaking, trendsetting silent SF classic METROPOLIS--1931\'s M is more than just a crime thriller.  It is actually a subtle comment on the sense of security that modern \\"civilized\\" people so blithely accept.  Lang so effectively blurs the line separating institutions of law from crime syndicates that he leaves viewers questioning whether or not society\'s leaders are actually capable of keeping its citizens safe and secure.  And indeed, Lang had good reason to pose such a question, as the Nazis were already on the rise in Germany at the time he was making M.  The film barely veils Lang\'s disgust for the Germany of that period--a Germany that could birth and foster a philosophy of hatred like Nazism--since the Berlin he depicts is dark with dirt and grime and the people all seem to have bloated, gnarly faces that are twisted into perpetual scowls.  That being the case, it is no surprise to learn that Lang employed actual Berlin residents and real-life members of the city\'s criminal underground to fill several supporting roles.M is also notable as the film that launched Peter Lorre into the international spotlight.  Lorre\'s gutwrenchingly emotive portrayal of a human monster who is unable to control his evil, deviant sexual impulses is nothing short of stellar.  Unfortunately, this performance also resulted in his being typecast, and it was afterwards difficult for him to secure roles outside of the noir or horror genres, even after his emigration to Hollywood.Released the same year as Tod Browning\'s classic Lugosi vehicle, DRACULA, M is actually the scarier of the two.  Although Lang\'s intention was for M to reflect the decaying and diseased society that WAS Germany during the years that culminated with World War II, it reflects just as poignantly the anger, violence, and social ambiguity so prevalent in today\'s world.  And that is very frightening indeed.The Criterion Collection DVD offers a visually stunning restored version of M in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and at its original 111-minute running time.  The disc plays the film with the original German-language soundtrack, but optional English subtitles are available.  Unlike many Criterion discs, there are no additional bonus features, but the opportunity to watch this remarkable and historic film as its legendary director intended makes amazon.com\'s less-than-suggested-retail price very reasonable.

Part of what is so compelling about this early talkie from 1931 is how MODERN much of it feels.  And is it really fair to give a movie points for simply surprising the viewer with how similar the plot feels to serial killer movies of today?However one might come down on that subject, I can\'t deny that this is a fascinating experience...made truly memorably by Peter Lorre\'s spectacular (and spectacularly over-the-top) performance as a psychopath before that genre was even remotely familiar.  He had no prior performances to draw from or reference.Lorre plays the normal (okay, slightly odd, but mostly normal) neighbor who \\"kept to himself...I never saw this coming.\\"  He is a killer of children.  He lures them on the streets with bon-bons or balloons and then they disappear...until their corpses are found later.  Although the film never explicitly mentions sexual abuse...it is deeply implied.M spends much of its time focusing on the investigation into these serial killings.  We literally have law-enforcement authorities talking to each other on the phone and detailing all the efforts they are making.  It\'s fascinating, because in the days LONG before computers or any tech gadgetry...these policemen undertake a painstaking and organized search for evidence throughout their German city.  What they lack in whiz-bang technology, they make up for in sheer numbers, determination and German precision.  And they REALLY put the squeeze on the criminal element of the city.  And this has a fascinating result of galvanizing the BAD guys into looking for this killer as well.  Not from altruism, but self-preservation.  This big search for a child killer is putting a damper on their business.So M is a serial killer movie, but truthfully most of it is more like a police procedural.  There are some pretty intense scenes as they get closer to their quarry...for such seemingly formal and dry material, the brilliant director Fritz Lang conjures up some real tension.  And when we do get to spend time with Lorre and the demons that plaque him begin to surface...well, the film becomes downright creepy.  Lorre throws himself into his role and his gigantic monologue is a bit overdone (it\'s more suited for stage than screen...but this was such a problem in those days), but it is also riveting and truly memorable.I think the best way I can articulate my thoughts about the film is to say that it really wasn\'t much like I expected it to be...it was better.  Lang is a master of mood and lighting.  Lorre is a perfect match of actor to role.  And both the psychology of the killer and the form of the police work make a great deal of sense.  You won\'t find yourself rolling your eyes at the primitiveness of it all...you\'ll be drawn in by much of the logic.  Not to say it\'s perfect...but it probably has no more holes than a typical episode of LAW AND ORDER.  I also felt the film was well paced, and even had a sly sense of humor at times.I watched the Criterion Blu-ray and it was excellent.  The black and white was gorgeous.  You\'ll note that many scenes lose their sound altogether.  Apparently, this was on purpose...so don\'t blame Criterion; blame Lang for a convention that feels odd.  Subtitles were sometimes hard to read.  I\'ve seen several Criterion black and white films lately that have surprisingly shoddy subtitles.The bonus materials are NOT shoddy.  They are plentiful as usual, but my favorite was the English language \\"redo\\" of the film.  They took the German movie and refilmed scenes, dubbed others and generally did a butcher job.  I skipped most of it, but you MUST see Lorre recreate his famous monologue in English.  It\'s far less effective and a great argument for letting folks act in their native languages.So a great movie, presented with typical panache by Criterion (subtitling being a notable exception).  Of course, this is a film for film-buffs and my review is written with that understanding in mind.  I\'m not sure what a more casual film fan might make of this.  I can envision them being fascinated or bored.  But if you\'ve read this far, I\'d say you\'re a film buff and this ought to go on your must-see list.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fascinating and surprisingly effective classic.", "unixReviewTime": 1326672000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2012"}\n',

When I first watched it, I was absolutely riveted.  While German cinema of this time period (1920s-1930s) was certainly edgy, experimental and deeply rooted in the social issues of the day, this movie stands above the rest.  It\'s one of the very first movies to examine the social problems of serial killers, pedophiles, mental illness and mob rule.

I almost felt like I was sleepwalking through someone else\'s nightmare. That ultimate nightmare where time drags through the surreal streets of utter abstract madness. A madness of people, who would otherwise be civil and respectful to one another, all on the brink of absolute hopelessness steeped in a most fragile sanity, unmasking their most base and animalistic instincts with every new situation and fear.\'M\' is much more than the murder of children. It is much more than the story of a murderer. It\'s really an indictment against \'humanity\'s\' illusion that human beings, the chosen and godly creation made in the image of God, are above the most base instincts of immediate self-preservation when confronted with hunger, fear and survival.We see how easily human beings turn into a lynch mob when confronted with the unspoken fears that darkly reveal the other, hidden side of human nature. Where I know you because I know me, and that scares me to death. For if your fears and prejudices and unresolved angst and frustrations are as deep-rooted and horrific as mine, then I\'m definately not turning my back on you. I\'m not even going to let you out of my sight.This is the paranoia running through the veins and skin within every human being. This is the atmosphere and reality running through this film.
