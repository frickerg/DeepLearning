Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who &quot;does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death&quot; is worth watching again and again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a man of character and faith", "unixReviewTime": 1077321600, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2004"}\n',

But when Frosty explains to him that he will melt if it gets too hot, they decide that it\'s up to them to help him get to the North Pole, so he won\'t ever melt. On their journey they meet many new friends, and adventures, but they also have to avoid the evil magician, for he has decided that he wants his magic hat back, even if he has to melt Frosty to get it.While the other Rankin / Bass holiday movies such as RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER and SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN\' TO TOWN, are filmed with clay-type animation, FROSTY THE SNOWMAN is not. It is done simply in the form of a regular cartoon, and even so, it is still one of the most enjoyable holiday movies for children of all ages. Frosty is a kind snowman who wants to please the children more than anything. Karen (the main child chracter) loves Frosty so much, and will do anything to help him. And Hocus (the rabbit who belongs to the evil magician) is very imaginative and intelligent. As well as a hilarious addition to the cast.

Mather", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "**SPOILER ALERT**I\'ll bet just about everybody has seen \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" at one time or another, and I can see why it\'s a classic. The animation may not exactly be top-notch (let\'s face it, Disney\'s animation was far much better; even in those days), but that\'s not really what matters. What really matters is the music, the acting, and the story behind the animation.It\'s the day before Christmas, and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman. After some debating, they all agree on the name \\"Frosty\\". They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle, who is just about the worst magician in the world. (He can\'t even perform a simple card trick, or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat.) The very second the hat touches Frosty\'s head, the snowman instantly comes to life. When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all, he decides he wants the hat back. The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend, but when the temperature starts creeping up, Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt. And what better place to not melt than the North Pole?So, the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station, and he and one of the children (a small girl named Karen) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north. Now, a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in--but only if one is a snowman. For Karen, who is made of human flesh, it doesn\'t take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold. Frosty knows that Karen can\'t stay in the car for much longer, so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they\'re out of the car, it still does not do Karen any good, for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness, where it is bitterly cold. Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out--someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death, and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle. Hocus Pocus (Professor Hinkle\'s pet rabbit, who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them. But Santa doesn\'t show up until nightfall, and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives, Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle, who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip, Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse, where a whole bunch of poinsettas (tropical Christmas flowers) are growing. Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse, Frosty carries Karen inside. Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse, and Frosty assures her that he\'ll only stay inside for a minute. But once they\'re inside, Professor Hinkle, who by then has caught up with them, shuts the door behind them and locks it. Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up, and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen. While searching for the two of them, Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse--the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped. Santa quickly unlocks the door, but once he gets inside, a terrible sight meets his eyes: Karen is down on her knees, crying her eyes out, and all that\'s left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor. Everything looks hopeless at the moment, as you can very well imagine. Santa, however, assures Karen that all is not lost. He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good; for he is made out of Christmas snow, and Christmas snow can never disappear completely. When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend, Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat, Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there. Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty, and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat, otherwise he\'ll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life. This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard, and he complains bitterly that it\'s not fair, for even evil magicians have to make a living. Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write \\"I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty\\" a hundred zillion times, and then maybe (just maybe) he\'ll find something in his stocking the following morning. Professor Hinkle agrees, and takes off for home as fast as he can, so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over. Santa then places the hat on Frosty\'s head, and he immediately awakens, much to Karen\'s delight. Later, Santa takes Karen home, and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole. Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty, but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas, and so he does. And every year from then on, Frosty\'s return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I\'ve watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember, and I don\'t think I\'ll ever get tired of watching it.

After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \\"Where did Santa\'s suit come from?\\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \\"Animagic\\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \\"One Foot in Front of the Other\\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred\'s a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that\'s a little corny) with merely the word \\"Claus\\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn\'t want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister\'s opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire\'s narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I\'d forgotten that the fairly dreadful \\"My World is Beginning Today\\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it\'s interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT\'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum\'s \\"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \\"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child\'s heart.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rankin/Bass classic is near the top of their game", "unixReviewTime": 1261612800, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2009"}\n',

Sam the Snowman (voiced by Burl Ives) brilliantly narrates the tale of an awkward reindeer and his struggle with discrimination. Along the way, he sings a number of holiday classics such as \\"Silver and Gold,\\" \\"Holly Jolly Christmas,\\" and of course - \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\".The story begins when Rudolph\'s father, Donner, tries to cover up his son\'s shiny, bright red nose with a disguise. When Rudolph attends a flight training school for young reindeer, he encounters Clarice - a young doe who thinks that Rudolph is cute. This revelation causes Rudolph to leap into the air and fly around the sky like a seasoned aviator. But when he lands, the nose disguise falls off and Rudolph\'s red honker is exposed to the scorn and ridicule of the young bucks in flight school. Clarice is the only one who doesn\'t view Rudolph as an outcast freak, but her father quickly escorts her out of the presence of such a \\"monster\\".Following this episode, Rudolph runs away only to meet up with an outcast Elf named Hermey who has committed the unforgivable sin of not wanting to make toys. Contrary to the social conventions of his time, Hermey wants to be a dentist. Feeling unwanted, Rudolph and Hermey decide to run away together. But in due time, they encounter the dangerous Abominable Snow Monster - a giant, hairy beast who crushes anyone who leaves Christmastown. Aiding in their rescue is Yukon Cornelius, a burly prospector who chops off a piece of ice with his pick ax, allowing Rudolph, Hermey, and himself to float away from the Abominable Snow Monster (who can\'t swim).After floating through the night, the three characters discover The Land of Misfit Toys - an island of handicapped, screwed-up toys rejected by elf quality-control managers and forced to live away their best years in an icy wasteland. Our three heroes can relate to the misfit toys, and Rudolph promises to inform Santa of their status the next time he sees him.When Rudolph sneaks away in the middle to return home, he meets up with Clarice (who ran away from home to search for him), and the two of them get cornered by the Abominable Snow Monster. But Yukon Cornelius faces down the Monster, and together with Hermey, he coaxes the beast into a trap - where Hermey neutralizes the Monster by pulling out his teeth.Meanwhile, Christmastown is covered with a thick fog, and Santa ponders the cancellation of Christmas. But when he sees Rudolph\'s bright red nose glowing in his workshop, Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh through the night. With Rudolph taking the lead, Santa swoops down on Christmas Eve just in time to rescue the depressed residents of The Land of Misfit Toys and deliver them all to expectant boys and girls who will love them for who they are.This breakthrough Claymation classic is essential for any child\'s Christmas experience (and that of adults who grew up watching much-anticipated annual holiday special on TV). That\'s why this ranks as a definite \\"must-see\\" by any standard. But undoubtedly, we all owe a special thanks to Montgomery Ward - the giant retail chain that created Rudolph as part of a promotional gimmick one fabled Christmas season decades ago.

I should know, having been picked on most of my life for having undiagnosed ADD.  Rudolph is the son of the famous Donnar, who is ashamed to find out his son has a red shiny nose that glows and gives off a horrific, wailing beep, so he tries to hide it by packing mud over it when a visiting, arrogant Santa disapproves.  Well, shame on Santa, and shame on the others--especially the reindeer clique--who picked on him.  They don\'t even take into consideration how well he can fly, or that he is a good \\"person\\" with a good heart.  All they see is his nose.  Fortunately, like any misfit, Rudolph has some allies in his mother, Clarice, Ukorn Cornelius, and Herbie the elf--a veritable misfit himself in Santa\'s workshop--who wants to be \\"a...a dentist.\\"Due to lack of acceptance, Rudolph and Herbie set off on their own to find their special calling, and meet up with gold prospector Ukorn and his pack of sled dogs.  Ukorn knows no fear, and is the only one who isn\'t afraid of the Abominable Snowman.  PCers lighten up!  Herbie removing his teeth was better than killing him, and the Abominable was indiscriminate about where he got his lunch.  Was Herbie removing his teeth awful in comparison?  I think not.The group lands on the Island of Misfit toys, ruled by a great and kindly lion king who wants Santa to find homes for them, and rightly so.  Everyone wants to be accepted and loved for who they are, don\'t they?  That is the lesson in this wonderful yuletide story for young and old alike, and it always puts most of us in the Christmas mood.  Did you ever notice how people are more accepting of those who are different around the holidays, and then they revert back to the way they treated them previously?  This story is about how anyone can change--even the \\"bumble\\"--that acceptance is a worldwide theme, and that\'s what the lesson is in this wonderful old classic.  It doesn\'t mean you should only make exceptions on the holidays, however, but you should be accepting all year long.  The spirit of Christmas should last throughout the year in kindness and tolerance of difference, which makes this appropriate for children of all ages.  It\'s a great lesson full of good old classic songs, and Burl Ives makes a great snowman narrator.It\'s obvious Rankin Bass put a lot of care into this one, and I also recommend Santa Claus is Comin\' to Town along with it.

Walker", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "I always loved the anti-authoritarian messages of the 60\'s-era Rankin Bass films. \\"Rudolph\\" is probably my favorite.  Its sense of history, and sly use of metaphor, are unrivaled among holiday specials. Santa is a case in point: the brash young rebel of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" has aged, like so many real-life revolutionaries, into a complacent, jackbooted despot. He has mislaid the flame of revolution, which is now in the hands (or rather the nose) of young Rudolph.To some degree, the tale is predictable, with a familiar set-up. A rebel-hero requires that the status quo (or ruling party) be, if not evil, then extremely jaded and misguided. Santa, the tyrant of Christmas Town, who has Castro\'s beard and pomposity, has built an austere, Walachia-like kingdom on the sweatshop labor of elves in the unregulated North. He seems the ideal villain-a capitalist straw man from a Socialist tract-and you eagerly await his downfall.Of course, Jolly Saint Nick can never be deposed. As a young man, he once swept the Burghermeister into the flames like so much tinsel, but in the centuries since he has become the face of a nation and seems destined to fade, like Castro, into white hairs and senility. Thus, the tension-how will they resolve it?Rudolph, shunned in his homeland, reaches maturity (like the prophets of old) on the howling wastes, where he regards the hollowness of Santa\'s regime.  Like Simon in \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" he realizes that the Abominable (the State bogeyman) is, in reality, just some harmless bugaboo, the product and victim of government hype. In a stirring climax, Rudolph the Red, assisted by an inner circle of misfits and weirdoes (including the defanged Abominable), returns to Christmas Town to confront Santa. He knows that the old regime, beset by storms and malaise, is doomed. What follows demonstrates his tactical genius: the venerable Santa will become the Revolution\'s impotent figurehead; Rudolph, its scorching beacon. The old king, recalling the glory of his own Putsch, hands the reins of power to the young firebrand, who quickly liberates the deformed misfit inmates of a floating Bastille (imprisoned \\"for their own good\\" by an imperious, leonine, eagle-winged warden) and unleashes them on society.

But one year, when Christmas has been officially cancelled, and Santa Claus can\'t find a way to guide his sleigh through the blizzard, Rudolph returns to Christmastown, where Santa Claus calls upon him to guide his sleigh, and where he becomes a world-renown hero.For everyone who has sung the song, the official story, and movie, is here.

Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and rejected reindeer; Rudolph\'s friend, Hermie the Elf, also a misfit because he doesn\'t like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius, the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a \\"bumble\\"); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion king; and many other characters and story threads.  The presentation, interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression, depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as indeed it should.

But where the 1964 production from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. achieved greatness was in the creativeness it showed with the supporting cast. The story is narrated by Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives (who sang the second most popular version of the song after Gene Autry\'s orignal), and Rudolph (Billie Mae Richards) becomes friends with both Hermey (Paul Soles), the elf who marches to his own drummer, and Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), the prospector. However, the most unforgettable characters in this story are the toys from the Island of Misfit Toys: Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant, and the others, along with their leader, King Moonracer.The result is a much deeper version of the story than was even hinted at in the lyrics of Johnny Marks\' classic Christmas song. We all now how the story is going to end on that foggy Christmas eve, so it is everything leading up to that fateful night that is where this story gets its deserved reputation as Rudolph is not the only one who ends up having their life take a turn for the better, as even the Abominable Snowman finds he can put the finishing touches on a perfect Christmas.

Despite the 25GB disc, the feature is presented in 1080p with a nice healthy bit rate, much higher than many big name movie releases sport. Since it is less than one hour long a BD 50 disc was not needed.This is one Blu Ray I was really looking forward to seeing and was hoping I would not be let down.  I WASN\'T !!  Contrary to some other reviews I have read I am here to tell you that this Blu Ray transfer of \\"Rudolph\\" is simply beautiful.  It is a MAJOR upgrade from the best quality DVD version you can find.  The colors are gorgeous, vibrant and strong.  Print damage is VERY minimal with my biggest complaint being a few stray hairs that show up for a few seconds perhaps 2 or 3 times during the almost one hour presentation.Remember that this was a \\"Stop Motion Animation\\" feature. This being the case you will notice the brightness flicker from time to time. This is NOT a defect in the transfer, it is an expected artifact from the process originally used to create this Christmas masterpiece.  The same goes for minor color fluctuations. All the artifacts that occurred due to the now primitive stop motion animation process are amplified on this release but don\'t let that scare you off.  It REALLY looks good folks. After seeing this year after year for 47 years , first in Black and White on our old Magnavox, later in color on our old Zenith, and lately upscaled to 1080p from my current DVD copy,  I was THRILLED to see \\"Rudolph\\" looking this good. WOW!Rudolph is presented with chapter breaks (w/thumbnails) and a set-up screen that lets you switch between a few other languages. This is a bare bones release with NO extras at all. The English audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 TruHD. Don\'t expect an Avatar type mix here! Rudolph was originally mixed in mono and except for a few special audio effects (snow, wind, etc) most of the sound will emanate from your center channel.  For this title I recommend switching your surround amp to \\"Stereo\\" and using the two front speakers for best results. Either way you wish to do it, the track is lossless, clear and as good as you will ever hear it. Dialogue is clear, songs all sound fine and it IS a noticeable bump in quality compared to my DVD version.If you are like me and have loved this film over the years then this Blu Ray release of \\"Rudolph\\" will not disappoint. Never in a million years did I ever think I would be able to enjoy this classic with such a beautiful , colorful and CLEAR picture!

Arthur Rankin\'s totally captivating stop motion animation was a bench mark for everything that has come since and even with all of our modern computer technology nothing could come close to the beauty of the creations here. The story of that most famous of reindeers, the one and only Rudolph who\'s initial drawback of having a shiny nose eventually becomes his chief asset, is beautifully told in a music filled special narrated by Burl Ives in a perfect piece of casting as Sam the snowman. This special has quite rightly become a Christmas instituation every year since its initial release and appeals equally to both children and adults with its timeless message of tolerance and acceptance of all who are different. It has happily now been given a deserving release onto DVD back in its original form complete with deleted songs and a superb restoration.Based on the immortal Christmas song by Johnny Marks who was also responsible for all the lyrics in this television production, \\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\\", tells us the entire story of this most famous reindeer and how he became Santa\'s best helper. Born with a strange glowing nose that invites the ridicule of all who know him, Rudolph sees his whole position in life ruined when he is passed over to become part of Santa\'s team of reindeers. Despite having the affection of young Doe Clarice, Rudolph sets out to find a proper life for himself and along the way not only meets some colourful characters but also encounters some real danger. Rudolph teams up first with Hermey, an elf who like Rudolph is considered an outcast in his community as he doesn\'t enjoy making toys and wants instead to become a dentist. The pair soon join up with eccentric prospector Yukon Cornelius on his travels which involve escaping the clutches of the Abominable Snow Monster and visiting the strange island of misfit toys who are waiting for Santa to find homes for all of the unwanted toys gathered on the island. Rudolph however returns to the North Pole just prior to Christmas to find Santa in an absolute state about not being able to do the present deliveries on Christmas Eve as a terrible blizzard has blown up making conditions impossible to travel in all over the world. For once Rudolph\'s shiny nose is viewed as an asset and Santa finally sees that only with Rudolph\'s help guiding his sleigh will his deliveries be able to be made. Rudolph thus wins total acceptance with Hermey also finally getting a chance to do what he really wants in dentistry with even the Abominable Snow Monster finding himself a useful role in being tall enough to  place the Christmas Star on Santa\'s Christmas tree at the happy conclusion.\\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\\", has been the inspiration for countless animators since 1964 with Tim Burton in his latest effort \\"The Corpse Bride\\", being the latest to pay homage to the genius of Arthur Rankin\'s work. I personally feel \\"Rudolph\\", is the crowning glory of the many fine animated specials produced by Rankin and his team. The characters in the story all have their own distinct personalities from the timid Rudolph, to the colourful Yukon Cornelius, through to the harried Santa and Mrs. Claus. Despite the limitations of this early animation it is a supreme achievement that these characters are able to convey identifiable qualities to the viewing audience. Particulary endearing are of course Rudolph\'s character who only yearns for the acceptance of his peers which I\'m sure we can all identify with, and Hermy who is also in the same situation. It was a wonderful idea to have the character of Sam the Snowman (who seems to have been the inspiration for the later Frosty the Snowman), present to narrate the story and they could not have found a more perfect performer than singer/actor Burl Ives to take on the voice of this jolly character. Ives at the film\'s conclusion gets the opportunity to sing the immortal title song which I feel is synonymous with the Christmas season and for which he as a performer would be forever after associated with. As befitting a family Christmas special \\"Rudolph\\", contains some other charming musical numbers as well such as \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\", and \\"Silver and Gold\\", that are sure to delight old and young viewers alike.Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is such a Christmas fixture that I couldn\'t imagine the festive season without a screening of this television classic. I find the special so enchanting not only because of its breathtaking animation and lovable characters but also by the charming innocence of the whole story, something which is sadly missing in much of our present day television programming. Outstanding Christmas specials that still entertain forty one years after they first appeared are few and far between and if you haven\'t had the joy of seeing the story of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in Arthur Rankin\'s television masterpiece then do yourself and your family a favour and treat them to a screening of it next Christmas.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Immortal Christmas Classic Featuring The Most Famous Reindeer Of All", "unixReviewTime": 1136332800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2006"}\n',

Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate.  Mel Gibson didn\'t simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way.  If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor.  We can make all we can out of our past and \\"the good old days\\" when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept \\"The Passion\\" well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package.  As a spiritual event, \\"The Passion of Christ\\" is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction.  As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas\'s betrayal, Christ\'s Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing.  The extent of Jesus\'s suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail.  There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson\'s rendering of each torturous moment.  If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances \\"Look, mother, I make all things new!\\"  Then, if there\'s incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging.  The presentation of the devil and Judas\'s anguish after his betrayal are fine interpretive moments.  If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible.  If you think that Pontius Pilate isn\'t the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.\\"The Passion of Christ\\" is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ.

The film has been the generator of an impressive publicity campaign: magazines, TV, newspapers, religious and non-religious comments, you name it. However, the most interesting thing about it is that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is not your typical Hollywood biography, this is not a crowd-pleaser, the film is a risky proposal and doesn\'t make concessions at all.Director Mel Gibson could have made a comfortable film, with well-known superstars such as himself in the lead roles, but the main criterion to chose the actors was that their physical appearance and acting style were suitable for the essence of each role. Basically, the cast is a bunch of little-known actors (at least when the movie was filmed): Jim Caviezel as Jesus, the gorgeous Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Rosalinda Celentano as Satan and Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Most of those names didn\'t say too much before the release of the movie, but their performances are solid and believable.In the technical aspect &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is EXCELLENT. The costumes, the makeup, the photography, the sets, the locations are amazing, you really get the sensation that you are a witness of the real events. The photography shows beautiful landscapes that made a big contrast with the tragic scenes in the movie, a very interesting combination. The music is atmospheric and the sound effects are very real.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; visually is one of the most powerful movies ever made because there are a lot of violent scenes, most of them are so real that you can almost feel the pain and the torture, definitely this is not a movie for little children, is a movie for mature audiences. By the way, there has been a lot of criticism for Mel Gibson because some people think that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is an anti-Semitic movie, that is, against the Jewish, but let\'s be objective here, the message is very clear and obvious, &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is a criticism against THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE, not against a specific community.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites everybody to reflect about our violent behavior, most of us are capable of using violent methods in order to get our own benefit. &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites us to reflect about our very own human nature. Definitely, Mel Gibson is a very, very interesting director, let\'s keep an eye on him, he might surprise us again, like he did with &quot;Braveheart&quot; and with &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot;.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A MOVIE THAT\'LL GIVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME", "unixReviewTime": 1091750400, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2004"}\n',

It is perhaps one of the most moving films ever made and one of the most important films for evangelism in today\'s secularist Culture of Death.Three years after its release (which, like the Gospels themselves, was a source of heated debate and division), it has been re-released as a \\"Definitive Edition,\\" with a number of special features:The movie is still in Aramaic and Latin, with subtitles. The purpose of this is to avoid \\"bringing Jesus into today\'s world\\" and rather force the viewer back in time, as if you were a witness to the actual events. Disc 1 has both the theatrical and re-cut version of the film, complete with accompanying commentaries by filmmakers, cinematographers, producers, musical directors and theologians. A particularly wonderful feature is an enhanced viewing mode featuring Biblical footnotes while the movie is playing. Disc 2 features one reasonably in-depth behind-the-scenes/making-of documentary. The other features on this disc include mini featurettes on religious art, ancient languages, a short showcase of the actual places in Jerusalem where the Stations of the Cross occurred, production art, a couple of deleted scenes, and a few other things like actors\' bios and (disappointingly short) lives of the saints.Personally, I found the discussion regarding ancient languages most interesting. Fr.Fulco, who served as historical and ancient language consultant during the scripting, shooting and post-production of the film, is erudite and well spoken. The section on religious art was quite engaging, but a bit disappointing in its superficiality (perhaps because I have a particular interest in art history and love the details). It would have been nice, for example, if the names of artists and some details of the pieces accompanied the art documentary and the art gallery. However, in exchange, the DVD gives a great mini documentary on crucifixion as a mode of punishment and execution.As far as the behind-the-scenes features, most touching were Jim Caviezel\'s humble and soft-spoken interview, during which he (and others) describes the physical, mental and spiritual anguish he was made to endure during the making of this movie -- which include, but are not limited to, eight-hour makeup sessions, itching, migraine headaches, freezing weather (while in a loin cloth), being whipped for real, having the several-hundred-pound cross fall on him and crush his skull, and being struck by lightning.Over these past three years, I have often wondered (with great frustration) why they didn\'t include extras on the DVD release of \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Perhaps the reason was that they did not want people to view this as a regular movie, concentrating on how it was made, etc. Rather, they wanted people to take the movie as it was and concentrate on the message and the emotional/spiritual impact that it had on them, as viewers. Whether Catholic/Christian, Jewish, agnostic or atheist, it is sure to have profound impact on the very fiber of every human being.This re-release comes at a good time -- just when the movie is starting to fade from people\'s minds. The strong impact that it had three years ago is starting to taper out, and people are settling back into their fast-paced modern lives, which too often results in a distilling of religious convictions and a laxity of spiritual fervor.Well, Lent is around the corner (February 21, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time.For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time.For those who have seen it, but don\'t particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again. This may move you to meditate on its scenes, pray and feel closer to God.And that is a very good thing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Definitive Edition...", "unixReviewTime": 1170547200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2007"}\n',

I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus\' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.  More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme.  There was blood.  There was torn flesh.  There were cries of pain, even from Jesus\' lips.  Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago.  We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don\'t \\"pretty\\" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus\' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our \\"Scapegoat,\\" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don\'t believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible\'s truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the \\"bad guys\\" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus\' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don\'t throw demons in where there aren\'t any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.  If you have questions about who God is, Yahweh through Jesus Christ, Yeshua, I suggest you go to my \\"so if you are interested in...guides\\" I\'ve made on Amazon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "With much thought, I wish to say a few things...", "unixReviewTime": 1077148800, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2004"}\n',

Never has a movie so violently assaulted my senses, affected my behavior, changed my thinking.There are many things to reflect on and talk about after seeing it, the group I was with went to a coffee place and discussed the movie for some time afterwards.  There are many symbolic things in the film, and a couple of people that night had already seen the movie twice, even though it\'d only been out two days, and they commented on things they caught the second viewing that\'d been missed the first time around.There is a lot of blood.  Christ\'s blood.  He died for the sins of the world and shed his blood for humanity.  That is the basic premise and story line.  This isn\'t the \'Matrix\', a great film with a Christology all it\'s own and ton\'s of symbolism, this is the shocking and offensive story of what Jesus did.  Raw and offensive and ugly.  He died naked and beaten on a cross of wood.If I would have a complaint about the depiction, as horrible and brutal as it was, was that the Christ was shown with the obligatory wrapping at the waist.  In the movie \'Schindler\'s List\' one of the great (in the sense of effecting the emotion of the viewer) scenes was when the prisoners had to line up naked and there, in shame and humiliation, await death.  I\'m curious as to why full frontal male nudity was used there but not here as it would have been more faithful to the text.  However, it\'s a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional \\"artistic license\\" not getting too much in the way.I\'m probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn\'t even more graphic, but I\'ll stand my ground on that one.  If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don\'t understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.

As the theater card commercials eased into the filmed commercials into the coming attraction commercials, you felt excitement and dread slowly fill the theater. By showtime it grew to  full, a good house for a night dominated for years by \\"must see TV.\\" Murmuring, chomping, bustling, and normal theater activity halted literally from the first scene where, without a title credit, you are placed in the garden as Jesus weeps and prays before His arrest and trial, challenged and victorious over an androgynous devil figure.In the two hours that follow director Mel Gibson, and his stars including Jim Cavieziel as Jesus and Maia Morganstern as His mother Mary, create what can only be considered a religious horror film. They use all trademarks of that genre: slow motion recreations of gore and brutality, tangible depictions and battles between good and evil (including demonic chase and possession), classically-based cinematography and a brooding John Debney musical score. All this in as historically accurate and visually beautiful a setting as such a film could take place. This is not the horror fantasy of Freddy Krueger slashing nubile teens, pointing to his glove and snarling, \\"This...is God.\\" The verbal taunts and physical punishment lie on Jesus, the Saving Victim Christians see as God made man.No one will leave this film unmoved. I and many around me cried seeing a bludgeoned Jesus comforted by (and comforting) His Mother; their scenes on Jesus\' walk to Calvary and at His Crucifixion are as simple and heartfelt as the beatings are excruciating. Gibson uses his considerable cinematic skill to slow down and intensify, rather than deflect, violence Christ suffers.His blood, which Christians believe washed sin away, dominates this film. It splatters on His torturers, oozes through the nails on His Cross, spurts from His side a Roman soldier pierces kneeling before Jesus\' Cross. (You wish Gibson would have allowed one of those centurions the line, \\"Truly this was the Son of God.\\") This film validates someone fully man as well as fully God suffered for our sins, and felt this unbearable pain doing so. (This, however, does not justify a rather sickening scene at the Crucifixion involving a crow which represents the film\'s most unnecessary violence and which even those supporting the film would decry.)No one will leave this film unblamed for Jesus\' death. It is no more Sanhedrin determination, nor Pontius Pilate\'s indecision nor his soldiers\' sadism nor Herod\'s drunken curiosity (the scenes between Jesus and Herod get as close to comic relief as \\"The Passion\\" allows, and it\'s not that close) which seals Jesus\' fate. Through flashbacks of Jesus\' ministry Gibson shows they - and we - are responsible for the suffering Jesus came to endure. (To that end, you wonder if Gibson could not have included a flashback to Jesus\' rebuking Peter - \\"Get thee behind me, you Satan!\\" -  after hearing Jesus announce His death and resurrection.)The showing I attended saw many people leave the screening, waiting in the lobby from the intensity of what they saw and felt. The audience left afterward stunned silent, the only film I\'d seen to prompt such reaction. (Gibson shows the Resurrection, earth\'s happiest day on which Christian faith is built, as a determined moment of mission rather than of celebration, complete with martial music.)No one can leave this film ambivalent about Jesus or His mission. Watching it, seeing his pain and vicariously enduring it, you must either accept Him as Messiah or dismiss Him as a madman. \\"The Passion\\" was made by dedicated, committed people and will demand the same of anyone, curious to brave enough,  choosing to view it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Most Emotionally Moving Films Ever Made", "unixReviewTime": 1078099200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2004"}\n',

If it is too brutal, too violent, too graphic, then those viewers need to get real ! There is nothing gratuitous,overboard or overblown. I have yet to hear anyone on the contrary say that they have found evidence or proof that the torture Jesus endured was a walk through the park. Also, I\'m sure there is some jealousy and resentment amongst the powerful film studio moguls(including those who did not want to touch or back up Gibson\'s project) who only wished they would have had half the vision and [guts] Mel Gibson possessed in directing The Passion of the Christ! Hats off to Gibson and the casting director for utilizing the gifted talents of international actors and not Hollywood\'s popular elite. Some may think Mel is \\"wacko\\" but after all there is a method to his madness or madness to his method that yields brilliant works such as Braveheart and now The Passion of the Christ...The passion for Gisbon\'s directing and vision surely comes through !Now, the film itself is a masterpiece in technical terms of cinematography, acting, costume and set design, special effects and soundtrack...Regardless if the dialogue was Aramaic or Latin, the subtitles did not hinder at all the action or watching the actors on screen. Nor do they deter the understanding of the story. The imagery varies from simply rich, panoramic, to haunting and nightmarish (involving scenes of the devil or his minions)! The artistic and skillful use of flashbacks to coincide with pivotal scenes (though every scene is practically pivotal) cannot be forgotten. One flashback involving Jesus as a beautiful and angelic curly headed toddler and a young Virgin Mother running to comfort him from a fall will put a knot in anyone\'s throat.It is one of the most emotional flashbacks regardless if one is a parent or not... The image is strong and will stay in the mind for time to come.I did not view this film in the hopes of being \\"entertained\\" in the regular or superficial sense of the word. I went to be further \\"educated\\". I was.Way beyond what I had expected. If you have not seen this film, forget any controversy or preconceived notions.Take any controversy, negative reviews out of the equation, and even forget Mel Gibson directed this for just 2 hours and see the film as it stands on its own...If you can walk away from this film extracting something positive and taken to heart from the viewing experience, and it is an experience(whether spiritual, educational, or other ways) then count yourself amongst the enlightened ones and not those who have become outraged or bittered.

(By the way, if he had wanted to be historically accurate he would have used Aramaic and Greek - almost no Roman citizens spoke Latin in their daily life.)This is a pre-Vatican II Christ, the Savior of power and majesty who dies for the sins of us all. It overlooks the contradictory Gospel tales, papering over the obvious problems one encounters trying to reconcile the many stories that have come down to us from oral then written form.  Gibson did not follow any one of the versions rigidly but instead created his own, a distillation of Catholic, Bibical and historical traditions.This is also the story of Gibson\'s own journey from believer to wayward sinner and back to the fold, much as he did in SIGNS. The score was particularly effective and even if one does not share the supernatural aspects of the story, it is powerful and wrenching.

How bout that?  Been quite a long time since I\'ve written a review for Amazon.com, and finally I\'ve written something that will rock with your head and eat your soul like my others.  Here\'s a review I\'ve put off writing for quite awhile because I really wanted to wait for the hype to die down.  And after reading so many different viewpoints on this website and others, it\'s caused quite a stir indeed.  Well, here we go.The film largely follows that of the catholic faith\'s \\"Stations of the Cross\\" and while I\'m not too entirely familiar with it, I know that it details the \\"passion\\" (literally meaning \\"suffering\\") of Jesus Christ and finally being nailed on the cross.  Mel Gibson himself is catholic and had this idea incubating in his head for years and I\'ll tell you what, this film really got to me.  It\'s wondrous cinematography (remember the film The Black Stallion?  Same guy!), authentic languages of Aramaic and Latin (which by the way, Aramaic was used by the common people, Latin by the Romans.  Just thought you\'d find that interesting.), and the wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus.  I previously saw him in \\"Frequency\\" and already knew he was a good actor, but this movie proved that he is indeed a GREAT actor.  Monica Bellucci, who played in the Matrix films and played a whore in that stupid \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" film, is Mary Magdalene here and also turns in a fine performance here.Gibson actually did some nice artistic touches here, especially with the flashbacks.  I think this is where some Christians get pissed off because he took a few liberties.  Example: in the Bible when Jesus is tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane, we see Satan (presumably) tempting him to not fulfill the prophecy.  While the Bible never outright says it is Satan, I found it very plausible.  Satan is regarded as the evil spirit, or the fallen angel, who tempts us through sin.  It would seem very likely to me that Satan wouldn\'t want Jesus to die for us.  Gibson also used the \\"original sin\\" idea, showing Satan with the ugly baby, and also with Judas being shameful and eventually killing himself for what he had done.My only complaint with this is I wanted to see a little more to the resurrection than we saw.  I wanted to see everyone\'s faces when they would see Jesus alive and well.  Oh well, I guess.  After all, no matter how well you make a religious film, it can\'t be perfect (and plus, that wasn\'t really the focus of this film).So why did it affect me like it did?  Well, I may be the strong religious person that I am (and loves heavy metal, how about that?), but in growing up in the Protestant faith, I never really concentrated on Jesus\' suffering; after all, without the resurrection, it would\'ve been a moot point.  However, when watching the film, all I could really think of was \\"He did THAT for me?\\"  I never really thought about what he went through, and this film changed my thinking forever.  I\'m not sure if I would outright tell you to see this movie because it\'s very graphic and poignant; however, if you do, I HIGHLY suggest you watch it with an open mind because I\'ve known people to hate it just because of their opinions on what the Bible is and so forth.  If you don\'t like the film because of its graphic nature, then you are well in your right.  If you don\'t like it based on your preconceptions of what Jesus went through or it disagrees with your religious opinion (for example, I have a friend who didn\'t like it just because he thought Jesus was totally human and not spiritually the \\"Son of God\\" and therefore could not live during the crucifixion.), then that is simply your opinion but I still can\'t help but feel like you are allowing those preconceptions to override the fact that this is indeed just a film, and the filmmaker is showing his deepest love for Christ.It\'s not a film for everybody to enjoy and even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.  But it quite possibly might have been the most influential film I\'ve ever seen in my life.

The fact is, unlike Gibson\'s previous two major historical outings (Braveheart & The Patriot) this movie is about 80 % historical sources (in this case the broad outline of Matthew and other synoptics, with dialogue therefrom), 20 % the director.  The other 2 movies had a less than 50% historicism & were well over 50% personally interpretive -- and at very critical points.  In my view these last two directorial attempts by Gibson were flawed for such reasons -- given very questionable historical interpretations in both.  These were the trepidations I had before viewing this movie, rather than the rest of the unbelievable hoopla.The fact is, lacking either Roman or Jewish sources for Christ\'s passion (although both the Roman Tacitus and the Jewish Talmud admit Christ was actually put to death during Pilate\'s tenure) there is no detailed historical source other than the gospels for this story, like it or not.  Coldly viewed, the film is thus no different than several other films which more or less rigorously follow some pre-existing text -- putting aside the question whether the text is fact or fiction, ie. Kubrick\'s Barry Lyndon ( historical novel), Fellini\'s Satyricon (ancient book that may or may not be historically based), The Bounty (mixed fact and fiction). It is virtually impossible to imagine a filmic treatment of any text that does not have at least a 10 to 15% dose of interpretation from the maker. So the criticism that has followed  is necessarily not based on the Gibson interpretation, but against the gospel itself.  The argument, necessarily then, must be that the gospel should no longer be represented filmically, for some reason.  This is a political question, since such censorship could only be enforced by political means.  Despite many expressed fears, such a result -- outright censorship -- is hardly likely in the United States, now or in the forseeable future.In brief, if didacticism is properly understood as the artist\'s overlay of personal vision and interpretation -- and not what the artist\'s personal creed (religious or political) happens to be -- the film is much less didactic than Gibson\'s other ventures into historical presentation, and for that matter much less didactic than the vast majority of other film.  The current criticism, again, necessarily is with Gibson\'s own doctrine; rationally speaking it could not be with the fact he has one (since any honest person will admit that every adult has some sort of a belief system in the broad sense of the word).The historicism of Passion is visually obvious to any rational viewer, believer or unbeliever.  To a disinterested viewer, ie., one without any particular religious axe to grind, the movie resembles nothing so much as an attempt to portray the confusion and cruelty of the ancient world in a highly realistic and authentic manner.  Why this should not be a valid enterprise for an American realist would be hard for critics to say; they avoid the issue.  Research on the institution of Roman crucifixion and scourging demonstrates that this sort of scholarship much more informs the making of Passion than, say, Gibson\'s use of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, which while it has been much vaunted is really only window dressing here.  The long and short of it is that the scourging (the truly new element in this passion film presentation, never previously so fully rendered in other films about Christ) is highly informed realism consistent with scholarship and with the reason for this scourging, in Christ\'s case.  See  Zugibe, \\"Forensic and Clinical Knowledge of the Practice of Crucifixion\\" (Turin 2000); Zaninotto, \\"The Shroud and Roman Crucifixion:  A Historical Overview\\" (Turin 2000).The realism and subtlety of the portrayal of Roman leaders and the Roman system in this film far outdistances the best of similar recent ventures, ie. Gladiator.  It matches the highest standard I know of in this area, Kubrick\'s Spartacus.  I doubt Gibson\'s Pilate will ever be improved upon; it is worth the price of admission.  You may like this or that disciple in the film more, but take a close look at Pilate if you can stand it; this guy is really us.I would also frankly admit that the Jewish authority figures are not presented with the same subtlety.  It would be a better film if they had been.  But their milieu in this film is not presented as malicious in any sense, rather highly confused (which Pilate points out).  In any event the figure who is quite obviously the hero of the film, in the full classical sense, Jesus, not only reinforces Pilate\'s verdict on their behavior -- \\"they know not what they do\\" -- but also explicitly forgives them.  A person attempting to pin an anti-Semetic didacticism onto this film therefore ignores the most pointed statements on the subject by the story\'s focus and hero -- a most dubious venture.  Of course, it is well known that the anti-Passion  campaign has only been successful by innuendo, guilt by association (Gibson\'s father), and other tactics unworthy of serious discourse.If one is reduced to keeping count of such things as an indicator, the subtlety of the psychological realism of the characters portrayed, and their corresponding sympathy, switches polarity at the street level (unlike Caiphas, most ordinary Jews at street level are remarkably \\"round,\\" in E. M. Forster\'s sense, as compared to the rank and file Romans who, unlike Pilate, are somewhat cartoonish).  Such an effect is not possible, of course, if the director or text is anti-Semetic.  Before using such terms regarding film, one ought to know the real thing by having viewed a couple \\"educational\\" films from Nazi Germany about the science of eugenics.  In any event, true racism is objectively presented in the movie -- of certain Romans against Jews.Beyond the authentic/realistic context, our hypothetical viewer without a particular credal axe to grind, knowing nothing of the new testament (like a man from Mars) would most likely just legitimately wonder -- why are they doing this to this man?  The film\'s explanation (based on Matthew) is Jesus\' apparent claim to be part of a deity, by a certain formula of words.  Focusing on the passion, the film does not fully explain this -- the man from Mars would basically come away with an impression of some sort of great taboo that was broken, causing frenzy and confusion among the Jewish authorities.  But again, malice would not be the conclusion.  Indeed Caiphas is portrayed as not wanting to kill Christ before the taboo words are spoken.  An objective atheist or our man from Mars could not then come away holding that any sort of assumed racial defect or malignancy was the cause.  If anything, it is the sheer power of the taboo that is the cause.  A true atheist or confident rationalist would not fear this critical focus of the movie, then, since he would reject the taboo ipso facto as a religious belief system.  Indeed he might well yet be interested in the film, very interested in it indeed, as a modern attempt to authentically portray the consequences of breaking a powerful taboo in the ancient world.The fact is, I have heard no criticism based on the fact that the movie justifies the breaking of the taboo against saying \\"I am.\\"  Yet a truly principled attack on the movie would not only have to start there, but grapple with that centrally, and then say something in favor of continuing that taboo in conclusion, ie, censorship of texts or artworks that include that verbal formula.  Of course, none of us have heard such a thing.Regarding the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the Marian and/or \\"stations of the cross\\" images, etc.:  this is nothing more than Gibson\'s signature, the 20% quotient of interpretivism.  It is mainly visual, and neither adds nor subtracts any major element not in the source, Matthew.  It is a question of emphasis.  And it serves to give artistic unity to the whole.  Yes, it does also admit that Gibson is a believer -- such an unambiguous admission to the audience actually being an honest, and therefore praiseworthy virtue, even from the perspective of an ethical pagan.  Only certain modern pagans, cut loose from Aristotle, Homer, and the roots of Western culture, advocate the creation of subversive artwork that fools or tricks its audience into beliefs or attitudes cleverly disquised or contra-indicated.  While a prime tool of Marxists, such tactics were considered unworthy in the ancient world and indeed there are no known texts from that world which employ such a strategy.Actually, the real subject of this movie is conversion.  Gibson conveys Christ\'s gaze as the operative machine of this process, with some analogy  to the fine use of Christ\'s shadow by director Nicholas Ray in King of Kings (1961).  Comparing and contrasting to this and other filmic precedents would be more interesting than much of what we have been hearing, not only from foes but also from some purported friends of Passion.I have been trying to write this in a manner to avoid taking a lot away from a fresh first viewing, which I certainly urge.  But I cannot help adding one last comparison -- of the Simon scene to John Paul II\'s poem, \\"Portait of a Cyrenean\\" a/k/a \\"Simon of Cyrene.\\"  One cannot claim that Gibson read the late pope\'s poem, but the visual parallels are remarkable.Actually, your best prep for this movie might be to rent out a good silent movie, like Abel Gance\'s Napoleon or anything featuring Chaplin.  The subject appears to have pushed Gibson back to the roots of cinema: gestures and faces.  Thankfully not everything is subtitled.My overall conclusion: 3.85 stars out of 5.  I don\'t hold with those that think this is the greatest movie ever made.  The Christian Word -- which includes the dogma of a personal Savior and all the eccentricity that may go with it --is  inherently incapable of a 5 star movie, or a 5 star artwork of any kind.  The closest post-Biblical Christian literature came to 5 stars was Dante, who admitted his failure in his Divine Comedy\'s last line, and that was a supreme admission from a very proud man and ought to set us all to fear and trembling.  Rembrandt for the most part gave us a lot of 3.75 star Jesus paintings, and to borrow from Hemingway, he probably had the best shot at the title.  Well, there is a fine Rembrandt etching of the Crucifixion that clocks in at about 4.1.  As for the movies, every sincere effort gives you a facet of the Christ -- Jeff Hunter in King of Kings, teamed up with Nicholas Ray behind camera, was heading for a 4.3 maybe, but as we say in Indy town, he \\"kissed the wall.\\"  See it again anyway and ignore a lot of the script (based on the top \\"scholarship\\" of its day, by the way).Saint Bernard, a.d. 1200, saw the West taking a questionable turn before the Renaissance, as far as religious art is concerned:  a return to sheer classic realism is a gain, of course, but also a loss because the room for the personal vision is thereby limited.  If you have seen Michelangelo\'s Pieta you cannot imagine that scene ever another way.  I thus don\'t grant any Michelangelo, DaVinci, Raphael, Bernini etc more than a 3.7 when it comes to Jesus Christ.  Mel gains not because he\'s more talented than those guys, but because those guys are his school and he builds on them.  Many justifiably still prefer icons in this particular competition.John the Apostle even threw in the towel on this one, you know: \\"He said many other things but not all the books in the world ....\\" & etcetera.  So as our famous dean of American realism might have put it, \\"Don\'t get into the ring with John the Apostle.\\"Of course, Mel did get into the ring, didn\'t he?  Of his hubris there is no doubt -- its just not very apparent in this movie, though, scene by scene -- or at least on the surface.  As for even undertaking the project -- sure, that\'s some hubris, all right.  But Gibson\'s stepping into this ring only proves that in the realm of art, certain rules can be broken if counter-balancing compensations are made.  Here, as in much of the best art of this country, the bow was to the aesthetic of realism with both feet.  The movie has much more in common with Clint Eastwood\'s unflinching look at the old west in The Unforgiven than with any filmed version of any didactic tract or religious text.  If you want your didacticism plain, go see a Star Trek movie and may be the wind be at your back.As for this film, there\'s enough going on in it -- including much not mentioned here -- that you should avoid as much of the debate as possible, even or especially from Mel\'s friends, and just go see it with an open mind as to what will hit you from a talented believer shrewdly aware of both his own limitations and those of film generally.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Trying to Look at the Passion Dispassionately", "unixReviewTime": 1128124800, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2005"}\n',

Yet, to not see such a film, to close one&#65533;s eyes to the message, is almost to deny the Holocaust.  Can we afford to do that?  Holocaust survivors emphatically say &#65533;no!&#65533;  In the same way, how can we sanitize Christ&#65533;s Passion and still come to terms with it?  If the violence of the film makes us uncomfortable, perhaps it is a discomfort for our own spiritual good.  That being said, I found the physical brutality far less appalling than the dark sides of human nature Gibson so graphically portrayed&#65533;the lusty sadism of His torturers, the calculating manipulations of the megalomaniac Caiphas, the mindless, reflexive scorn of the Pharisees, the debauchery of Herod, the crass moral relativism of Pilate, the utter indifference of the people, and even the temporary cowardice of Peter.  It is far less unnerving to watch physical acts of brutality I would never think of committing than to watch these spiritual acts of sinfulness I commit daily to one degree or another. Yet, there is more than enough human goodness in the film (to say nothing of the subtle but powerful portrayal of His divine goodness) that I came away with great hope and a raised spirit.  The devotion of the Virgin Mother, the amazing conversion of Simon of Cyrene, and the periodic flashbacks to inspiring events in the life of Jesus, show us that with His help and example and inspiration, we can see evil for what it is and begin to overcome it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magnificent!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1078099200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2004"}\n',

However, the cinematography, acting, directing, etc. are all tremendous.  It is too strong for children, so don\'t let your non-teen children see it unless you want them to have nightmares of bloated-eyeball Jesus.  It is a gory torture movie full of blood, pain, and little else.  That said, I think it should be required viewing for everyone else on Earth.  Historically, religiously, and culturally, the film is a triumph, and seeing it make $300 million + at the box office amidst all the cruddy kiddy movies was extremely satisfying.  But don\'t listen to me--you\'ve already probably decided whether or not to see it.  Here is what this movie will be remembered for after all the hype dies down.Passion is an anomaly within its admittedly odd circle of like-minded films.  Compare 10 Commandments, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, etc. to this film and you get the feeling that the Christians have finally caught up to the realistic standard in cinema since those films were released nearly 50 years ago.  It really is a step forward even from Scorsese\'s The Last Temptation of Christ, which was released over 15 years ago.  (If you hate that film, by the way, you probably haven\'t seen it.  It\'s a beautiful expression of faith in its own right.)  Finally, Gibson takes the bible-history movies into this millenium.Passion is a film made by Christians for Christians.  I know many atheists who saw the film, however, and at least respect the principles of Jesus now.  If anyone says that this is not an achievement, then they know nothing about the difficulties of trying to preach to the uninitiated.  Those people on the street corners handing out flyers get spit on daily; they have guts, too.  Think they\'re nuts if you want, but admit their determination is uncommon.In the same way, it\'s necessary to appreciate the message of this film:  this is the man we have based our religion on, and this is what we know he went through.  In dealing only with the tribulation of Jesus, Gibson reduces belief to pain.  Would you suffer physical pain for the notions you hold true?  Few would.  This, my friends, is why we still see him as a model for the rest of us.  Jesus had inner strength uncommon in man.  Gibson is no savior, but he does remind us of something vital with this film.Mel Gibson has a lot of guts.

All through the movie, we see the demons, Satan, the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this.

Crucifixion displays the victim as a symbol for all our various fears of death and pain.

On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan\'s pet serpent under his heel.In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate\'s wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the \\"king of the Jews\\" to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a long time, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas\' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries \\"It is finished\\"... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you\'re mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don\'t even think about the actors... it\'s too real.

And people, it\'s okay to be catholic hater of this film or an atheist lover of it, but people seem to think you either are catholic and hate it or anything else and love. As for the anti-semitics? Please.The film chronicles the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ\'s life according to Mel Gibson so this film isn\'t a pseudo documentary where every event actually transpired(even if people doubt he actually existed).

He\'s taken to Pontius Pilate, but he won\'t sentence him, King Herod won\'t either. But instead of risking a rebellion if Christ is freed, he orders his death by crucifixtion.While beautifully shot and some great performances even if you can\'t understand a word of Aramic or Hebrew, there is some problems. One: there\'s cases of extremes. The priests who want Christ are SO determined to get him sentenced. The Roman guards come off as extremely sadistic and almost seem to take pleasure with scourging Christ with poles and a vicious-looking cat o\'nine tails(it looks like a claw). As for the violence, it is disturbing to a fault. There\'s a part where one of the claws is caught in Christ\'s side and is yanked, thereby pulling off some of his flesh. I don\'t know about you but does that seem necessary after such a brutal torture already? Or how about the 6, count em 6 times Christ falls when carrying his cross to the hilltop? Although one shot is can certainly be disheartening when Christ, nailed to the cross, has to be turned over but from the look of it, would hit the ground face first with the heavy cross crushing him although he\'s stopped.

The first focuses on the teachings of Jesus-especially the \\"love your neighbor\\" part.  The approach believes very much that Jesus came here and he had something to say.  The approach has had a long and honorable history within the Church.  Past a certain point it begins to break apart as far as exactly what it was Jesus had to say; but it is generally agreed that the message was of divine origin and reflected something about the mind of God.  In this regard, The Passion Of The Christ comes up short in that it is devoid of clear spiritual teachings.  Even the flashback to Jesus\' Sermon on the Mount seems more than just a little subtle.  Instead we have a gut wrenching account of Jesus\' sufferings on the way to the cross that is frankly more than many can endure.  Indeed, many members of the \\"Jesus-Giver of Spiritual Wisdom\\" school have a difficult time giving the crucifixion a meaningful place within the Gospel.  In some ways, by this viewpoint, the whole \\"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried\\" part of the Apostles Creed seems more a distraction from the message of Jesus than an illustration of some moral message.  Thus several reviewers have remarked that Mel Gibson has utterly failed in his project by not placing the story of Christ\'s final twelve hours into a larger spiritual framework the viewer could walk away with.But there is a second approach.  This approach believes that the Gospel (and the secret of life for that matter) is not a collection of spiritual wisdom or a code of ethics and conduct.  This approach believes that the secret of life is a person.  In other words, Christ did not come to walk among us to get us to be better people or live on a higher spiritual standard.  Christ came to reconcile us to Himself.  He came so that we could place our trust in Him and trust in His righteousness to make us acceptable to a Holy God.  In this view, Gibson\'s movie makes sense.  The whole drawn out tale of the suffering Jesus makes sense because Jesus Himself is the point.It offends many that this one man in one particular time and concrete place is believed to be the meaning of it all.  It defies all reason and common sense.  Yet this is what the faith proclaims.  Hence at least some of the criticism this film has received is actually an expression of outrage at this very suggestion.There have been some complaints that in this version of Jesus\' death that the Roman Governor, Pilate, is viewed with some sympathy.  Indeed, I think Gibson has done just that.  But whatever sympathy Gibson shows for Pilate is offset by the ghastly brutality of the Roman soldiers.  And troubled or not, Pilate cannot absolve himself of his part in the crucifixion by washing his hands anymore than he can declare himself a bird and fly away.At the viewing I attended, the audience was dead quiet throughout the entire film.  No one ate and only a few bothered to drink their sodas-those that did did so only to calm the upset in their stomachs.  Surprisingly, the toughest part of the film was not the hanging on the cross but when Jesus is beaten with a variety of whips.  To watch a man have the skin ripped from his body is an astoundingly harsh experience for the viewer.  It is with this particularly long scene in mind that I cannot recommend this film to younger filmgoers.This is a painful film to watch.  Most of the audience cried at some point.  A few had to leave the theater.  When it was over the audience walked out not speaking to each other.  This film is meaningful in the extreme to Christians long familiar with the habits of Lent and Easter.  It is definitely a Catholic view of the crucifixion-even so, it is not so oppressively Catholic that members of other denominations would find it distracting.  Most leave this film deeply moved and without regret for having watched it.Only time will tell if this film will have a lasting place among Christians.  I can scarcely imagine what place it will have in the world of filmmaking.  There is no other film like it.  The only film I have heard it compared to is Schnildler\'s List in its depiction of brutality.  It could be for that very reason it will be ignored in the long run by the film watching public.  Like Schnildler\'s List, it may be more honored than watched.  But this is an important film as a film.

Mel Gibson has made a film that shows us just a portion of what Christ suffered for mankind.  (It is important to remember that the word passion has a root that means suffering.)  If you don\'t believe or don\'t know the story the violence might be all you can see.  However, I saw Jesus reaching out with love, trying to teach, through all the torture and barbarity even while on the cross.  Tears come easily while watching this film because I know my sins put the whips and hammers in my hands and that Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, and that with his stripes I am healed.James Caviezel certainly portrays the suffering of Jesus, but more importantly he also always projects the absolute submission Jesus has to God\'s will and his boundless love for every human.  I particularly loved the scene where the man who had been compelled to carry Christ\'s cross to Golgotha looks into the eyes of Jesus and is tormented because of the love Christ still radiates.  I remember one of the negative reviewers said that the words of Christ asking his Father to forgive his tormenters (us) were not in the film.  That is wrong.  They are in there twice, when he is being nailed to the cross on the ground and another time shortly before he dies.The other actors are fine as well.  Hristo Shopov was very fine as Pontius Pilate as was Claudia Gerini as Pilate\'s troubled wife.  Monica Bellucci adds a haunting beauty as Mary Magdalene.  However, top honors goes to Maia Morgenstern as Mary.  She brings Mary to life as I have never seen before.  And when she looks straight in our eyes as she holds the broken body of her son you know she is not condemning us.  No, she is asking us to understand what her son (and she) gave for us and asks us to accept that sacrifice and let it change our lives.The actors who played the priests, the vicious Roman guards, and the crowds who called for Jesus\' death should all be commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.

His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened.  This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth.

The film doesn\'t pretend to be anymore than it is: a thorough examination of Christ\'s passion through graphic (one could not exactly say literal)depiction. Because of the film\'s intense focus, I gained a much deeper understanding of what exactly the passion of the Divine Christ was: His absolute, uncompromising, and, most of all, completely self-sacrificing love for humanity.By focusing on the essence of Christ\'s mission, in a brilliant exposition of the film-maker\'s art - we are shown the exemplication and demonstration of perfect self-sacrificing love, the true Altruism, which He was sent into this world to teach, and the intolerably brutal and vicious way in which we treated Him.To the credit of the film, we are not allowed for a second to forget that God\'s begotten Son took upon Himself the form of a man, and therefore, was subject to that human sensitivity which experiences pain and travail. And who among us, with all the agony we do experience, could have endured what He did for our sake?  Herein, the film shows us what Christian virtue is: to bear our Cross, without complaint or rebuke.  The film really does a superb work in showing us that Christ\'s passion for our betterment was great enough to transcend any agony which we could inflict upon the flesh.I understand the heart of Christ\'s teaching as stated in the Gospel of John to be thus:1) \\"... that you love each other as I have loved you ...\\";2) that \\"... there is no greater love than this: that one might lay down their life for their friends (or enemies, or anyone at all)...\\"What I don\'t understand is how one can watch this film and point a finger at anyone, Jew, Roman, Iraqi ... anyone, other than at themselves.

The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus\' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified.  Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event.  Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie.

This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt.  Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them.  On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go.  It was memorialized as the Passover Feast.  The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie.  One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the \'Death Sentence\' of Jesus to understand.For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God.  That\'s always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season.

Dein \\"passafist\\"", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "In my attempt to compose some semblance of thoughts about Mel Gibson\'s new film THE PASSION OF CHRIST.  I must admit I may ruffle some feathers, and create some heated debate.  Let me be the first to say any condemnation I place on myself first.  Nothing I am about to write is an indictment of any faith other than my own personal self.Religion is such bondage.  Whether you like it or not, religion is as flawed and cumbersome as any belief system. This is why I chose at a very young age to be a follower of Christ, because He came and reformed the broken religions, created and instilled a grace I could never deserve.Mel Gibson\'s THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is the kind of movie that restores my faith in the cinema.  It is moving, sick, beautiful, sadistic, and probably the most challenging two hours I ever spent in a theater.  It is the most violent, brutal, honest and powerful film I have ever seen.  It the kind of movie I do not ever want to see again and yet probably will see many times, because it is that terrible to watch, but also so compelling.  I left the film changed and for the first time in my life, something that I thought was so close to me became more crystal clear then ever.  For the first time I saw the true power of cinema and true power of God\'s ultimate grace.  I would offer that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is one of the greatest and most challenging films I have ever seen (sorry Terry Gilliam, but BRAZIL is my number 2 now).As the film opens we see a short verse from the book of Isaiah, (Anyone whose familiar with the Heavy Metal band STRYPER from 80\'s will remember this verse well):But He was pierced for our transgressions,He was crushed for our iniquities,the punishment that brought us peacewas upon Him,and by His wounds we are healed.-----Isaiah 53:5(NIV)This passage was written hundreds of years before before Jesus Christ was born.  According to the New Testement, this verse was written to tell of the eventual outcome of the coming Messiah.  It is too bad the high priests of Jesus day were so busy trying to hold onto the religious control of their people that they missed the true Messiah standing in front of them.  In their attempt to keep their grasp on the people, they enlisted the help of one of Jesus\' friends.  They arrested Jesus Christ and carted him away, placing Him in front of the high priest Caiaphas.  Then they dragged him in front of the Roman magistrate Pontius Pilate.  In a less than valiant effort to save his own skin and politcal power, Pilate pawns this man he believes to be innocent in front of the garish and ineffective figurehead of a king named Herod.  Herod sends Jesus back in front of Pilate who does everything in his power to save this innocent man.  Alas, he gave the Christ over to the crowd to be scourged and ultimately crucified.The rest of the story involves some of the most realistic and brutal scenes ever put on film.  If you thought SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER\'S LIST was hard to sit through, then you cannot fathom how horrible it is watching Christ get scourged, watching metal rip open his skin.  I honestly thought I could take it.  I was wrong.  Any person who thinks mankind is basically good needs to watch how the Roman guards treat Christ.  The funny thing is, I realize how easy it would be for me to place myself in the story.  How easy it would be for me to follow the crowd and how easy it would be for me to treat this man as badly as the Roman guards treated him.What I loved the most about THE PASSION were the tiny moments when the people who were laughing and scorning Jesus soon realized who they were dealing with.  Some looked on with fear like Barabbas or one of the thieves on the cross.  Others looked on with reverence like the Roman centurion who pierced Jesus\' side or Simon, a young man who was thrust into the story to help carry the cross. It is the small moments of reality that hit these people that make me glad that sometimes in chaos, people can rise above.I also found myself in the same boat as Peter.  Here is a man who has followed Jesus to the mountaintops.  He promised to stick by his friend forever, yet when the going gets tough, he shows his cowardice by lying and denying his friend.  To be honest, I shed many tears after this scene.  How many times have I done that to save face?  How would I have felt in Peter\'s situation? How many times have I have sold out my friends for acceptance and to place myself on a higher wrung?Mel Gibson has done the unthinkable.  He has created a film that not only incredibly moving, but also accessible.  It is hard to try to put the life of Jesus into the context of His death because it seems so pointless.  What did this man do to deserve the pain of the cross? Why do people revere Him so much? Why do so many blindly follow? Mostly, why is a man like Christ worth the fuss?  It is simple. We as humans treated God like a piece of junk and yet He forgave us.  This whole episode was necessary to human existence.The final ten minutes of THE PASSION are both moving and damaging all at the same time.  As Jesus dies the screen goes black for what seems like an eternity.  It was not nearly enough time to compose myself, but what follows is a sweetly lyrical approach to the resurrection that does what it needs to.  So many films leave Christ hanging there, in their own way acknowledging that he may have had a bunch of great ideas, but beyond that, who cares?  Without the resurrection, the crucifixion is an innocent man getting the tar beaten out of him for 45 minutes. With the resurrection, the crucifixion is a story of hope and of grace: something I do not deserve.The cast is phenomenal.  Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern hit the right cords when they have to.  Playing these characters is difficult because there is always a tendency to over and/or underplay them.  They also fill in a canvas that borders on realistic and stylized.  I do not think anyone with even any ounce of compassion could not be moved by the pain of watching Morgenstern (who plays Mother Mary) and Bellucci (as Mary Magdelene) wipe up the blood of Christ.I would love to hear what those who disagree with me have to say.  I would love to hear what those whom have no Christian faith think of this film.  Even if you do disagree, do me a favor.  If your mind and soul are in for a challenging and deeply troubling film, give THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST your attention.  Even if you are unfazed, I promise the film is brilliant, and I have only said that about five films in my lifetime.  You may just leave the theater at least a little changed.

This is the main reason why such religious portrayals are viewed as highly controversial accounts, and much becomes muddled or lost when the plot or storyline is overanalyzed as a result. When \\"TPotC\\" isn\'t seen or viewed as an accurate account of biblical events, and is seen as a grand display of theatrics involving visually stunning physical scenarios not disguised as works of art, is when it results as a picture worth viewing many times over. And \\"TPotC\\" contains an exponential degree of props (of both the physical and intellectual variety - which are prime factors contributing to the outcome of this fine, upstanding work of art). In conclusion, one must leave their theological preferences (as well as religious prejudices) at the door, in order for \\"TPotC\\" to have any real merit of entertainment value (of which there is a high degree). Be warned, as this epic contains graphic images of violence. Language buffs will enjoy the eloquently spoken Hebrew dialects (including the English subtitles). Please, by all means, view this picture with an open mind, and above all, listen without prejudice (and ignore those blasted critics!)!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\\"...Passion...\\" meets Controversy", "unixReviewTime": 1078790400, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2004"}\n',

Some such as Forrest Gump, We Were Soldiers, Titanic ... but this extremely violent portrayal of Jesus\' crucifixion has brought me to complete utter silence.  It gave me quite an emotional experience.The movie portrays Jesus living his last 12 hours of life on earth, fulfilling God\'s Purpose for all mankind -- ALL mankind!  Yet sadly, many cultures don\'t seem to get the picture.  The film clearly illustrates the brutal hell Jesus went through, from sweating drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane to being pertrayed by a kiss, from facing powerful Roman leaders to being spit upon; from enduring non-stop torment of razor-sharp metal on a whip to finally bearing a rough, heavy wooden cross.  I was utterly surprised to notice how many times Jesus had stumbled while bearing that cross, yet I assumed that Jesus was going through utter pain at the same time.  Oh friends, he did this JUST FOR YOU!I have to admit something was telling me that I was going to walk out of this movie stunned, so I had to warn my spritual kin with me that this film was going to contain extreme graphic violence.  I was right all along!  You can\'t comprehend the intense suffering Jesus went through.  He saw it all along.  He had a ticket to escape from Jerusalem and go on an expedition or something.  He could\'ve left when Pontious Pilate offered him the chance, not once, but many times.  He could\'ve blah blah blah -- but He decided not to.  He knew all along He was called to fulfill the Scripture.I was not surprised to see other movie goers wiping tears from their faces.  I can understand why this movie generated controversy to the media.  But hey, we need something like this in a generation where entertainment is venom-saturated.  You know what I\'m talking about.One final summary is that this is without a doubt the greatest film which portrays Jesus\' crucifixion.  Also featured in the motion picture is segments of the gospel in Jesus\' earlier life, like the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper.

Reading through the negative reviews most of it was degrading and rather common place bashing, yet some of the negative reviews raise some important points (And I\'m not only referring to the gore here) and some of these do more good than a fanatic review. Yet, as a Christian myself, I know I cannot judge this movie without ever looking at my own belief. I was on the way of becoming an atheist and completely lost my faith in God when my mother got cancer and battled it for years. Yet she, the one who was really suffering, took great comfort from praying, reading the gospels and so on. It was this very disturbing experience (My mother\'s painful death) that made me think. And then I heard about this upcoming movie... The rest is history.Well, for starters, Jesus HAS lived on this earth and was crucified as several Roman historians and more prove. I encourage everyone to watch the BBC Production of \\"Jesus from Nazareth\\" for an IMHO historical and rather rational view on the most loved or hated man that ever lived. An great addition would also be the German \\"2000 Jahre Christentum\\" which can be bought on Amazon.de. Now what happened after Golgotha is up to what you believe or not. But I would never dare to ridicule someone for believing in whatever he chooses because faith is something very personal. That is why reviews that attack those who believe in Christ disturbed me more than the movie. If logic rules the world: Why would those sarcastic atheists even bother to watch a movie on a person they do not respect?As for Antisemitism, I saw none of it. The Romans were portrayed as bloodhounds, not the Jews. And remember, Jesus himself was a Jew. And just because some weren\'t good people doesn\'t condemn an entire people, I believe that if we\'re as smart as some reviewers who cried \\"Antisemitism!\\" proclaim we are, we should be past that. There are not so good Americans, Austrians, Australians, Chinese as well as not so good Jews. We\'re all fallible, aren\'t we? Just as not all the Germans were not has horrific as movies like \\"Schindler\'s List\\" or \\"Hasenjagd\\" portrayed the really evil ones, not ALL the Jews were good or bad either. There are black sheep everywhere. Why does something that common place even have to be explained? The whole movie wouldn\'t work if ALL the Jews had wanted Jesus to live, just as \\"Schindler\'s List\\" wouldn\'t work if ALL the Germans had opposed Hitler\'s scheme. (I\'m not comparing the holocaust to Jesus\' Passion, I\'m merely trying to explain why it wouldn\'t be plausible in another way) What am I saying? Don\'t regard a movie just as either Black or White. This movie, with all its crude gore, doesn\'t white-wash anything as much as it doesn\'t blacken history. It is realistic, painful to watch and made me throw up more than once.It\'s not entertainment but a reminder of what has been and what has been played down in most versions on Christ\'s life, esp. \\"King of Kings\\" and \\"The Greatest Story ever told\\". An example of \\"playing down\\" would be how Caesar\'s murder has been put on film numerous times. Most of these neither follow the historian\'s GORY descriptions nor do they dare to show what is described in all its gruesome details. The closest version to the actual event as described is the mini-series with Jeremy Sisto as Caesar but even that one is \\"easy on the eyes\\". Now \\"The Passion\\" shows that Jesus didn\'t die as \\"beautifully\\" as the famous paintings made us think he did. It was gruesome, gory, inhuman, sweaty, dirty, swollen, bloody, ripped... you name it.As for the movie\'s power: The score alone is enough to go straight to the heart. There are several gems of masterful directing in this movie that I won\'t ever forget. (Such as the \\"Ecce homo!\\") Which brings me to the subject of Mel Gibson: Neither the sad fact that Mel\'s father denies the holocaust (A belief Mel does NOT share and shouldn\'t be condemned for) nor his personal life or opinions on women\'s rights or whatever should influence your judgement. What did one NEGATIVE reviewer ask for? An IMPARTIAL view.Now would I ever watch this movie again? No. I cannot bear it. THe experience is unlike any other. It rips you apart, each lash has the power of a stabbing dagger. The gruesome details are too much to stomach. But I\'m glad I had the courage to watch it. I\'m glad for it as a Christian for this vivid presentation of HIS suffering I have realised that whatever makes me feel \\"blue\\" is nothing compared to real suffering. Codemn my belief all you like but I cannot disregard this film and its influence in a positive way. HIS message was love. And atheist or Christian, that doesn\'t sound like a bad idea.

But some of us seem to be talking about just the disturbing gory violent scenes.  I pointed out a few details to my boyfriend on the older DVD using freeze frame.  He\'s Christain, I\'m Wiccan, We Co-Exist and we like the film.As a film buff, I\'d prefer to stick to the story of the film and pay little attention to the disturbing violence (Ex. when Jesus\' flesh is ripped, exposing his ribs).  And speaking of which, you haven\'t seen \\"disturbing violence\\" until you have seen another Controversial film, Sam Peckinpah\'s \\"Straw Dogs\\" with Dustin Hoffman, which didn\'t rely on gore.When I saw it in the movie theater on Free Movie Night (College Students Only) in 2006, a friend of mine sat next to me and grabbed my arm.  When we were watching the crucifiction and the Roman soldier had to pull Christ\'s arm out of the socket, I immediately told her to let go.So, living in the bible-belt and going to college there as well, there wasn\'t a dry eye in the house when the theater let everyone out, except for 4 of us that had walked over from rehearsal for Orpheus Descending.Personally, I still don\'t think \\"The Passion\\", while focusing on the last day of the life of Jesus Christ, can compare with the similar retellings like \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" with Max Von Sydow, \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" with Robert Powell, the equally controversial \\"The Last Temptation Of Christ\\" with Willem Dafoe & \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" with Ted Neeley.

My long suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Christianity appeals to this \\"aristocracy of the spirit\\", which is often a gentler spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women.  You don\'t need to be a Christian to feel for Christ\'s suffering so graphically (perhaps too graphically) depicted in the film. It is violent, not hiding behind pretense. It will be disapproved by the modern Western progressives who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators (like Hitler or Stalin) make it bad. Actually, Christ\'s radical message was the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted. Special effort is needed to make us love one-another -- not somebody of the same tribe or family - that would be easy, but the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men in spite of the fact they are sinners partially because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. They would not hesitate to crucify Christ again. Christianity never ceased challenging human illusions. The best of it preaches religion of the spirit, other-worldly, preaching charity and humility, trusting Providence and submitting to it, and setting its heart and its treasure in heaven. Whereas other heroes may imagine they can liberate the whole humankind, Christ was more concerned with individual human souls. And there is a question of mercy and the state. Seems to me, mercy is an aristocratic value, it is opposite to the self-righteousness and drive for revenge, which are the things of democratic mob. I\'m deeply skeptical about the ability of modern state apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions.

He wasn\'t the Roman monster everyone likes to make him out to be (for the simple reason that the Romans followed a Pagan religion - there\'s prejudice for ya). He was rational, yet firm in that he did what he had to do - HIS JOB. Pilate wasn\'t a Jew, and therefor didn\'t [care] about Jesus\'s messiah preachings. It was Pilate\'s job to govern the people and keep the peace. And because Rome was a Republic at the time, it followed the will of majority - and the majority wanted Jesus dead. So that\'s what Pilate did. This DOES NOT make Pilate a lemming - he did then what politicians don\'t do now - what the people want them to do.I highly recommend this film to those who have a fascination with the Roman time period or etymology - or with violence.... and more than plenty of it.

But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn\'t resist adding my two cents.I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson\'s contribution to civilization.Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive.  Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day\'s catch.  Muhammad\'s words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any \\"nonbelievers\\". The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a \\"blasphemer\\" when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other \\"blasphemers\\" in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God.What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30\'s and 40\'s). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and don\'t feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind.

Mel Gibson may have walked his own Via Dolorosa to make this film but the result is not only worth it, it\'s astonishing!This depiction of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most extreme pieces mainstream cinema ever offered to a public audience, though ironically perhaps, this film would probably have caused much less of a stir among our great-grandparents generation than it has among us.  There is no compromise here, from the first scene as we descend from the clouds into the garden of Gethsemane the viewer becomes a silent observer at the pivot joint of history and is spared absolutely nothing.  This is not a film you watch as much as witness.Much has been made of the level of violence in this film, with one critic going as far as to call it a \\"Theatre of sadomasochism\\" and another calling it \\"The Gospel according to the Marquis De Sade\\", but modern cinema contains an absurd level of violence, the body count in the average Schwarzenegger movie makes \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" look almost mild by comparison.  But what we are accustomed to seeing is violence that has been sanitised for our consumption (or is it delectation?); the truly horrific effect of a bullet or a knife on the human body has been turned into light entertainment or titillation.  I can\'t help but feel concerned that respected critics feel that it\'s permissible to feed the public a constant diet of gratuitous violence in what amounts to a moral and ethical vacuum, with no effort being made to show its real effect on the victim, the victim\'s loved ones and even the perpetrator.Likewise charges of anti-Semitism have been made against this film.  Well what can I say about that?  What once person finds deeply offensive another person may not have a problem with, offense like taste is a most subjective matter and I can only give my opinion.  In my opinion, many of the individual Jews portrayed here such as Simon, Veronica and Mary Magdalene serve to give the film its humanity.  The mob portrayed while on the surface Jewish, seemed to me on a deeper level to represent a cross section of all humanity rather than focusing on any one particular ethnic group, serving at least in part as a warning of the ability of the mob to override the individual\'s sense of justice and morality.  The overwhelming message being that Jesus willingly gave himself up for the sins of the whole world, which is explicitly stated at the beginning of the film and while a mind already poisoned by hatred and bigotry may take a different meaning, in my opinion I don\'t feel that \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is either deliberately or accidentally anti-Semitic.But whatever one may feel about this film, what nobody can deny is that Caleb Deschanel\'s cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the delicate use of colour and texture serve to make this film a deeply tactile experience.  The acting performances are universally masterful; the score provides the backdrop to the images while never drawing undue attention to itself and Mel Gibson\'s direction shows all the depth and subtly of the greatest directors.  But really all this is academic; the ultimate test of this film is the reaction of the viewer.  I was deeply moved by \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" and for me personally the most affecting parts were the almost peripheral events such as the denial of Peter, the total despair of Judas, the torment of Pilate, the compassion of Veronica and Simon and in the end if a work of art moves the viewer on a deep and personal level, what more can it possibly hope to achieve?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A film to stand with the greats", "unixReviewTime": 1080777600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2004"}\n',

Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera; you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson\'s visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus.

It\'s too horrible, too deeply disturbing, to watch, for me. That said, I\'ve made sure to watch it in sections from start to finish for it truly is a magnificent film, a film that needed to be made. It\'s a film that stands as a testament against the powers that be today similarly as its subject was a testament against the powers that be. Unlike so many films made today - for example the recent Noah, or the Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson - this is not a film that had to mangle its subject to make room for the director\'s ego. Rather, this film delivers as accurate a portrayal of the Passion of the Christ as this world will likely ever see in cinema. The stories surrounding the making of the film are fascinating in themselves.Why watch this incredibly disturbing film? It\'s sublime. Schopenhauer\'s definition of the sublime in Art, as I recall it being described, was of a force too great to be contained by the three-dimensional forms of time and space moving into the present, an aesthetic experience that is beyond moral judgments of right and wrong that touches the spiritual \\"third rail\\" of Creation. Similarly, James Joyce wrote of what he called \\"aesthetic arrest\\", an aesthetic experience in which one is neither drawn by desire nor repulsed by fear but simply locked into a profound meditative assessment of truth. These ideas are my best approach at answering the question of why to watch this film. There is something cosmic about this film. The miraculousness of the Passion narrative communicates itself through this film. So yes, hard as it is for me to bear watching it, I cannot imagine going through this life without seeing it, several times, for unless one is a mystic or saint this is the closest one will ever come in this lifetime to witnessing the Passion of the Christ.

I will, however, try to give my two-cents-worth on it.The bottom line for me is this. This film is excellent. The performances are solid and emotional. The music is brooding, haunting, tense, and beautiful. The photography is the same for me. Often dark and gloomy and gritty but it works. It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment. It is like SCHINDLER\'S LIST in the sense that it is unflinchingly brutal in it\'s depiction of a very emotional and true event.I was crying almost THROUGHOUT the film, at LEAST five times, but I lost count quickly. People asked me how old a child should be to see this. My answer was don\'t take children. If you REALLY want to, see it yourself and TALK with your child about it before going in. Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can. To me it is the most moving film of the past 11 years. I hope that you can go see it, and if you do, may you come away with a reminder of just how much the Lord Jesus Christ really loves you.

Thus, those who understand the theological message will not be so much offended by the violence as moved to greater spiritual awareness.  Those who do not understand the message or simply do not agree with it will see nothing but senseless, meaningless, unrelenting violence.It has been funny to see Hollywood scratching its head, wondering how such a film (in Aramaic and Latin, no less!)could become the 9th most popular film of all time.  They just don\'t get it.  They don\'t understand that there are many people, millions of people, who are starving for religious content in films.There is an audience out there that wishes to see films of a religious nature.

Yes the movie is amazing, yes it is a story that has a deeply religious theme however this is not the kind of movie that children should be watching.

Everything from costumes to landscape is a sight to behold. I do not believe that it is possible to leave this movie and not feel moved, even though I am still not religious I will say this; if half of the movie is based on true events then Jesus Christ truly gave up more than any of us can ever imagine.

Since I hadn\'t experienced it by myself I refused to make an opinion out of something I didn\'t know unlike some others.Finally I saw the film and the word to describe it that comes to my mind is \\"extraordinary\\".I didn\'t find anti-Semitism, which is not only something against the philosophy of Christians like me, but also against the very message of the film. The film can be seen as a story of forgiveness, love, sacrifice and faith. Anyone who thinks or perceives the contrary about it, didn\'t get it. Gibson said this himself and after watching the film, I must agree.But taking the religious controversy aside, the film is both beautiful and brutal. The cinematography is dazzling, the acting is astonishing, the frames are powerful in all senses. The film is in simple terms, a work of cinematographic art.I only found two problems, but  I also understand their reasons.Firstly, there is too much violence and blood. Despite reality must have been like that (or even worst), Gibson took no compassion on the audience and pointed the camera right into the most difficult angle to watch emotionally speaking. His intention was clear, he wanted to ignite a storm of emotions on the viewer (and he succeeded), but personally I think it will take me some time to recover from that before I raise the courage of watching it again. Then again, this film is intended to be an artistic and personal experience, not an entertainment.Secondly, I felt Gibson left me in expectation. He used flashbacks to some of Jesus\' teachings. Some of them, like the \\"love your enemies, if you only loved the ones that love you, where would the merit be?\\" were perfectly handled. But one in particular, the attempt to stone Magdalena, felt to me as if it should have been larger and more specific. I got the message, but I felt left in expectation. The other part, was Jesus\' resurrection. A little time devoted to Jesus\' contact with his apostles, or perhaps his conversation with Magdalena would have been welcomed. The film would have been around 10 minutes longer, but it would have been more powerful.But in the end, Gibson\'s intention was to show the last 12 hours, and in that he delivered in a extraordinary way. Kudos to Mel Gibson for devoting himself so deeply into this project and achieving what he did.Gibson made with 23 million dollars, what others would have needed more than 80 million to do.

You may object, but it is, after all, my opinion and not necessarily yours.Obviously this film was not intended to be entertaining.  And it is not.  The filming, directing and acting are superlative.  I\'ve never seen better.Although the film is based on the New Testament Gospels, which I have read off and on for three-quarters of a century, Mel Gibson took several liberties with the orthodox version of the events surrounding Yeshua\'s death, which is what the film was designed to portray honestly, as I understand it.I\'ve sold Catholic Bibles, and am familiar with the protestant version as well.  I don\'t recall any justification for the raven plucking out one of the thieve\'s eyes on the cross, as it was portrayed in this film.  Also, the appearance of Satan with a reptile in the Garden of Gethsemani was a fictional addition.  It is my understanding, also, that it was Roman practice to drive spikes through the wrist, rather than the palms--although the Bible does mention the resurrected Christ offering Thomas to touch his hand wounds.  The nailed hands would not hold up the crucixion victim, but in this case his wrists were bound to the cross, which would seem to nullify that objection. and it was the custom for the crucifiction victims to carry only the crossbar, rather than an entire cross to the place of execution, as indeed the thieves were shown doing in the film.  Why was He singled out?  Maybe we\'ll never know the answers to some of these questions.When I was in my mid-twenties, in the best condition of my life, I think that I could not have carried a cross made of six-by-six timbers, of the size depicted, any distance.  I could barely have picked it up, and I was a strong young man.  The cross in the picture was carried by a man who had just been subjected to a scourging and whipping which had left him half dead, and judging by the amount of blood sopped up at the whipping scene by the women (Mary the mother of Yeshua (Jesus, in the Greek translation) and Mary Magdalene, he couldn\'t have had much blood left in his body, which brings up another problem:  there is no mention in the New Testament of the women doing any such thing...and, why should they have?In the movie, he was tried four times, once by Caiaphas, the High Priest of the Jerusalem temple, once by King Herod, King of Judeaee, and twice by Pontius Pilate, the Roman Procurator.  All in one night and day.  And Herod\'s palace was not even in Jerusalem, although he may have been there for Passover.  In three of the gospels, the trial by Herod is not mentioned; only the Gospel of John (the last of the canonical Gospels written) refers to it, and does say that he was in Jerusalem.First, he was beat up by the Jewish temple guards, who took him in Gethsemani with the help of Judas Iscariot (liberties were taken with his death scene, also), then Pilate had him flogged near to death (the beating alone, as depicted, would have killed any ordinary man halfway through it), and finally he dragged his cross all the way to Golgotha (with some help).The movie was filled with gratuitous brutality and cruelty not justified to the extent depicted by the accounts in the Christian canonical New Testament Gospels.  In fact, throughout those accounts, the impression is that he was calm and dignified throughout the entire tribulation, until the very last, when he was on the cross.  Even then, he seems to have maintained his composure, even through his pain.  A far cry from the Jesus depicted in this film, I think.Which brings me to my main concern about this movie:  No one can doubt that the Roman\'s method of capital punishment, crucifixion, was brutal.  It is also written in the canonical Gospels that he, Yeshua, was scourged (whipped, or flogged), which necessarily was also brutal.  But, even so, I, my wife, and the couple with us--although we were expecting to witness brutality--did not expect the horrendous, unspeakable brutality to which we were subjected, nor the heartless jeers and laughing of the Jerusalem crowds and the Romans who were inflicting the torture.  It seemed endless, and unspeakable, comprising most of the movie.  We were unanimous in our opinion that the movie was over the top in its depiction of cruelty.  If the intent was to make the viewers appreciate Christ\'s suffering for our sake, as they all say, I think it was overdone.  Most of us appreciate it already.This movie will probably win an academy award for filming, acting, directing, and a half-dozen other things.  I repeat: it is not entertainment, nor ia it particularly edifying.  Christians already know the story.  Non-Christians have no reason to see it, and will not appreciate the subtle allusions to certain biblical references.As for the accusations of anti-Semitism, I think any hint of it was overshadowed by the rampant anti-humanism.  The Romans were, by far, the most likeable characters, with the exception of His followers, although they were the ones who inflicted all of the brutality.  There were at least a few of them who showed some humanity.DO NOT take a child to see this film.  I was ready to leave before it was half over, because I had seen enough torture to last me a lifetime, and was not learning anything I didn\'t already know.I do not find this kind of film entertaining or edifying, and it is an experience that I can do without.  Real life is bad enough, without depicting fictional events that are even worse.Sorry, Mel.  Your heart was undoubtedly in the right place, and technically it was a masterpiece.  You deserve praise for the attempt.

First of all the violence in the context of this film was a condemnation of cruelty. It is as it was, and (as bad as it is) , if anything the reality was more brutal than the depiction here. I did not experience the desensitizing of violence as some have described, I felt every blow. There is no pleasure taken in the cruelty on the part of the film. It is too much for kids that may not understand the context and message. (Certainly no one under age should ever see it, and then only some will understand it. It is rated R for a reason.Second the only prejudice in the film is (rightfully) against evil people and the one they serve. Yes, Satan is in the film. Before you say that artistic license was taken, I would assert that Satan being the father of evil is implicitly present where there is cruelty. By including Satan in the depiction, the film makes very bold and brave revelations on the nature of evil. There are profound truths revealed that no other film has addressed so directly and eloquently. Satan appears as a sadistic mocking force of evil that takes many forms but has a hideous similarity in every incarnation. You will notice in your own life that the most cruel people you encounter have that same presence. Another insight into the nature of evil that this film shows is that when a person does evil, Satan does not empower them or protect them, but instead takes as much pleasure in torturing them as he does in torturing the innocent. Those that say there is no message have not only missed all of this, but they have missed the messages of Jesus that are covered in the film.There is an amazing moment when I found myself thinking how shameful and tragic that God should give man the greatest gift and man destroys it, when suddenly the shot is from God\'s point of view and I am feeling the same as he is. The film is a true artistic triumph as well, with it\'s amazing cinematography, and in my experience the authentic language helped immerse me in the story.

Indeed, so much controversy has been stirred, it was difficult to watch the picture with an open mind - I knew so much of what to expect.  So, let\'s begin by addressing the Big Questions.Question #1, Is the film anti-Semitic?  I do not believe so.  It is true that the main villain in the movie is the high-priest Ciaphas.  Some critics have protested that we do not see enough of the reasons for what he does.  He was afraid of stirring up the people and he felt threatened by Jesus.  That said, it is important to realize having reasons for doing a bad thing, does not excuse doing the bad thing.  In this case, a supposed \\"holy man,\\" a hypocrite, is instrumental in having an innocent man tortured and killed.  The same can be said for Pontius Pilate - yeah, he was trying to keep the peace, but since when is that an excuse for psychotic murder?  Watching The Passion of the Christ, I was reminded of another movie - Schindler\'s List - in which an evil government used institutionalized torture and murder against the Jews.  True, the Romans were not trying to commit genocide and they did not kill the millions the Nazis did, but the Jews were still subjugated.  The Roman centurions are the real thugs of this movie.Question #2, Is the film violent?  Yes.  It is relentless in its depiction of Christ\'s torture.  The complaint against most Hollywood Biblical epics is that they are silly, corny, sentimental stories.  NOT THIS ONE.  As soon as the film begins, it is in your face all the way.  Another reviewer has claimed that the violence is \\"pornographic\\", as if this were a snuff film.  I have seen films with pointless violence - this is not one of them.  People have grown familiar with the story of the Passion and they want it to stay nice, comfortable, and safe.  IT IS NOT.  The thing is that I believe that this is an ACCURATE depiction of what was done to him.  Should we not see the senseless killing in Schindler\'s List?  The concept that many people cannot grasp is, in movies ABOUT pointless violence, the violence is not pointless.  The entire reason this movie exists is to show what Christ went through.This movie doesn\'t have an arc in the conventional sense.  It is a docudrama chronicling that last hours of Christ\'s life.  Jim Caviezel is a robust, manly Jesus.  We can see how he could lead a vast movement.  The film is heavy-handed in places - I was reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar when Herrod was portrayed as a demented drag-queen.Is the film powerful?  Yes, undoubtedly so.  You will be unable to get it out of your head afterwards.  Yet, for all the violence, it is incredibly life-affirming.  Jesus\' message - that we all have to love each other - comes through.  When we don\'t...well, just watch the movie.This film is capable of stirring tremendous religious fervor, and perhaps that\'s what people are afraid of.  The final image of the film - I won\'t \\"spoil\\" it for you, but you should be able to guess - is incredibly uplifting.  It almost has the feel of a superhero moment - inspiring all of us to take up our crosses and continue to fight for good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An open mind...", "unixReviewTime": 1077667200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2004"}\n',

The only controversial thing I can see Hollywood getting upset over is the fact that Mel Gibson, chose to give the story of Jesus\' final 12 hours the respect they deserve by truthfully, Biblically, and accurately depicting the events leading up to the crucifixion.\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" chronicles the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ, from the moment he was taken into custody all the way up to the crucifixion and resurrection.  In that time we, the audience, get to see realistically what Jesus went through according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Many critics felt the film was overly gory and grotesque in the way the scourging and crucifixion was portrayed.  I beg to differ, the scourging was in line with the way Romans punished criminals, or in this case perceived criminals, and the crucifixion was portrayed very realistically.  To ask Mel Gibson to not show the agony and torture Jesus endured to save mankind, would be a disservice to Mel\'s beliefs and the beliefs of other Christians, and Jesus himself.

This movie warrants that for its artistry and acting alone.  The way words are conveyed through expressions and symbols that are more universal than the Christian religion itself makes one understand why Mel Gibson did not initially find it necessary to release this movie with subtitles.In the story of the last hours of Christ, we have a compelling story of betrayal, denial, greed, forgiveness, anger, envy, redemption and just about every single element that the Bible identifies as a fundamental flaw or attribute.  What we see onscreen is not some anti-Semetic screed.  Far from it.  Gibson has taken liberties only in the scourging scenes that are performed by the Romans and in two flashback scenes meant to illustrate the human bond between he and his mother Mary.  Both the Jews and Pilate are portrayed the way they are portrayed in the New Testament and herein lies the problem.  For the fundamental divide between Christians and Jews is the story of Jesus and the New Testament.  The New Testament is in and of itself anti-Semetic to many because of the way the death of Jesus has been used for hundreds of years to stereotype and persecute Jews.  There are complaints about historical inaccuracies, but this seems like nitpicking in a movie that is so obviously relying upon faith and the book of that faith.  You can\'t blame Jews for being sensitive to this issue, but the kneejerk negative reaction is both out of line and outdated for modern America.As for the film itself, Gibson has made an endurance test, but it all has a purpose.  Those who say the lessons of Jesus are not conveyed in this film must not have watched it.  For they are clearly and artfully conveyed through a series of well-placed flashbacks that tie in to the current situation being acted out on film.  The underlying theme of forgiveness is emphasized on multiple occasions, so the serious watcher will not come away with the impression that he or she should go out and kill some Jews.  At worst, they may come away with the condescending belief that they should openly forgive modern Jews for whatever ills their ancient ancestors inflicted upon Jesus.This is a movie about faith and reinforcing that faith by showing the suffering of Christ in his last hours-- the suffering that he apparently endured for all of man\'s sins. It is a very Catholic film in that sense because it really pushes the guilt-ridden side of Christian theology (i.e. Jesus died for us all so feel so terrible about it that you never forget it).  But whether you believe in Jesus Christ or the historical accuracy of the Bible is not the issue.  Whether you can accept this movie as an articulate portrayal of religious text is.  There are certainly better stories to be found in both the Old and New Testaments, but Gibson has made this one as good as it can be.  The film itself is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  The acting is magnificent and the costumes and settings perfect.  The only problem with the movie is that the story is not particularly compelling to this non-churchgoer.  Yet to Gibson\'s credit, he makes it at least interesting and emotionally charged.  All of this is a credit to a great director who has assembled a very fine group and made a very fine film.If you doubt Gibson\'s intentions because you find him to be a religious nutjob, then I can only ask you to study a scene right at the end.  When Jesus finally succumbs and is dead in Mary\'s arms, she looks down at her son, understandably griefstricken.  You start to think that this is the part where Mel really sticks it to the \\"Christ-killers\\".  But no.  Mary looks up with an unforgettable look of resignation and sadness in her eyes.  It is not an angry look, but a look consistent with Christianity\'s most fundamental tenet-- forgiveness.  That is the image that lasts when the movie ends shortly thereafter, and as a result it is also the lesson that lasts.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "well done and well intentioned", "unixReviewTime": 1092960000, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2004"}\n',

From the news to billboards to newspaper and magazine articles. The movie definitely lived up to the hype.This Jesus movie outshines the 50 others you could fine and for great reason as well. All other Jesus movies just take you right through, while Passion of the Christ diligently takes the time to accurately and vividly portray Jesus\' final hours on Earth. This film adds on the realism by having the actors speak in Aramaic NOT English.The movie begins with Jesus\' prayer in the garden and ends at tomb on resurrection Sunday. I must warn that this movie is not for the faint at heart either. When I said that this film vividly portrays Jesus\' final hours, I meant it. They make the beatings Jesus take in this film very brutal. Even his crucifixion is barbarously dramatic. But the realistic drama in it all is what makes this gem so powerful and moving. The brutality in it all really makes you realize just how greatly Christ suffered for each and every one of us, believers and non-believers. The beautiful and peaceful score for the Resurrection as well as the scene of it all puts tears in my eyes every time I see it which capitalizes on this overall amazing, awe-inspiring Jesus adaptation.Overall: I have made it a tradition to watch this movie only once every year on the eve of Easter. I feel that if I watch it more than once a year, I won\'t be as touched by it. It\'s that good of a film that it should only be watched once a year! At least to me it is.

Therefore, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a great movie that will forever resonate in the history of the cinema. It is a beautifully shot film where the contrast between darkness and light accentuates the beauty of the aura of Jesus Christ. Unlike other Biblical adaptations, Gibson\'s new film is flushed with dramatic colors that appear gritty in order to emphasize realism. It is not idealized for it is emphatically proven through the sheer violence.The movie opens with Jesus in the evening at the Garden of Gethsemane, where everything appears cold and vile. Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer, does an exquisite job in painting out the mood with its contrast between shadows and light. At first, Gibson did not want to include subtitles because he wanted to tell the story through images alone and I believe it would have been persuasive. In a story where it clearly deals with the battle between good and evil, Gibson and Deschanel designed the cinematography where lightness and darkness are fighting for their share of screen space.\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" deals with the last twelve hours of Jesus\' life with occasional flashbacks. There is no setup or a background insight as to why Jesus is being persecuted but there is no need for it because the only importance is the sacrifice of Jesus. Also, I guess Gibson expects us to know and if not, we should research. There is not much plot but simply the journey Jesus makes carrying the burden of the wooden cross up to Golgotha. Gibson basically follows the story set by the scriptures but only twice does he deviate from it. The first is introducing Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) into the narrative and the second is adding more emphasis to the role of Simon of Cyrene. The Satan character is done so seductively that it will send chills down your spine. I love how Gibson chose to portray evil as beautiful, seductive, and wicked as a way to entice desires. I also admire Gibson for adding depth to the character of Simon of Cyrene who helps Jesus carry the cross. It addles me how even with Gibson\'s mold of Simon of Cyrene; people still dare to accuse him and this film of being anti-Semitic and the ignition of it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Depiction of the Bible", "unixReviewTime": 1077926400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2004"}\n',

But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it\'s feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn\'t some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus\' life as described in the Gospels and that\'s pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ\'s hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier\'s smirking face.  That\'s a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I\'d assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus\' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism\'s staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it\'s all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty \\"Catholic\\" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I\'d prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus\' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I\'m not sure that this movie will make many converts - it\'s a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus\' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (\\"This is my Body, broken for you...\\" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (\\"Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.\\").  I\'m not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it\'s already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it\'s a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can\'t wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended.

The acting is super.  Jim Caviezel probably gives the best portrayal of Jesus ever film. He is able, I assert, to give Jesus the universial appeal deserved in  such a character.  Maia Morgenstern is outstanding as Mary and her portrayal brings compassion from the viewer. Monica Bellucci is great as well.  One of the most intriging characters is how Mel uses Satan.  The charcater is adrongynces looking and comes at times in the film adding the dimension that this is more than a physical battle, but a truly spiritual war.  It is nothing short of genius.The film score compliments the film.  The film does suffer from some flaws.  The resurrection is so brief that Christ looks more like the victim than the victor.  Sure he was a victim, but as Lord he is also the victor, and after such an intense two hours of physical and spiritual violence, a stonger resurrection scene would have inspired more hope in the viewer.The flashback scenes are very necessary and allow the viewer to escape the violence in the film, if only for a minute.

What I saw was a very moving, compelling and disturbing dramatization of the last 12 hours of Christ\'s life.  The violence in the movie was extreme, yet there were only a couple points that I would say were gratuitous.  One would be the very long procession to Golgatha and the second would be the crow incident.  Those who have seen the movie will undoubtedly undertand exactly what I am referring to.  Also a bit over-dramatized is the guilt of Judas Iscariot.  The scenes with the children beating him and Satan watching were truly disturbing.  Exactly what Gibson wanted but I am not sure if it was necessary.  I think that the movie is visually stunning and technically excellent.  It is well researched with excellent actors and actresses.  The use of subtitles does not in any way detract from the impact of the movie.  There are some criticisms however: 1) There is not enough of who Jesus is.  We see bits and pieces in flashback, but more could have been added during some of the more extreme scenes ie the second half of the flogging 2)There is not too much information about Jesus\' followers. Peter is mentioned and John seen as is Judas but of the other 9 nothing.  Of the 2 Marys, one is obviously the mother of Jesus, but it is not apparant who the other is till much later.  For all the information you receive about her she could be any of the many women who followed Jesus.  The third and final criticism is about the finale.  Gibson spends the entire movie building up Jesus\' suffering and death and the payoff is the Resurrection, but the Resurrection only gets maybe 30-45 seconds of screen time.  This is a bit of a letdown.  The audience has seen the suffering yet is really denied the triumph.  The actors do a great job in promoting emotion etc.  Caviezel plays Jesus with a quiet majesty and in the flashbacks, his performance is so good I wished for more.  As for the charges that film is anti-semitic, they are ludicrous.  First, historically, it was the leading pharasees who wished for Jesus death.  That is historic fact.  The Romans were instruments of that death.  Gibson\'s film points out that not all of the leaders wanted death for Jesus and many were oppossed to the trial itself.  The crowd was paid off as seen in the movie.  The brutality of many of the Romans is caused by the alcohol they drank before the crucifixtion, which is obvious especially around the cross.  The soldiers involved in the scourging did not seem to have an excuse for their cruelty, as they were not drinking.  Gibson does point out the sympathetic Romans also.  Unlike the TV movie Jesus from a couple years ago Pilot is portrayed not as insane but as indecisive and scared.  This also comes through.  Overall the Passion of the Christ is a very good movie that builds up to a climax that is underplayed.

It\'s a very heavy movie, however, and very difficult to watch. I don\'t like to see people getting hurt, so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me.

The movie was not called &#34;The Resurrection of Christ&#34; but instead &#34;The Passion&#34;--the resurrection is for a different story. I\'m sorry if you find me to be a heretic, but the movie was one of the heaviest, saddest, and most poignant emotional experiences until that ending--to me, it felt like Gibson tacked on a \'happy\' ending for the sake of frightened audiences. I know how die-hard Christians feel about that ending, but to me it just seemed to undermine Christ\'s suffering (I\'m speaking in terms of the movie guys). But other than these quibbles, I thought the movie was very moving, very violent (not nearly as bad as critics like Roger Ebert made it out to be--it\'s about suffering, geez), and very deeply felt. At first I was skeptical of Gibson\'s take on this material, but I\'m glad that I watched it. I was very impressed with his style. J. C.\'s performance as J. C. was absolutely stunning, and the guy was struck down by lightning on the set for Christ\'s sake! He is a wonderfully endearing actor. This movie kicked up a big stink at the time of its release, but soon it will continue to fall away to the dustbin of history when the spiritual orgasms over its violence have subsided. I didn\'t feel guilt at the end, but rather a deep and forbidding sorrow--this is a really sad movie, and I like it for that reason. Even nonbelievers will be touched, if only they will put aside their prejudices long enough to watch it. I did, and I enjoyed it--if enjoy is the right word for this kind of controversial, &#34;be careful what you say about it&#34; movie.The BluRay set is fantastic. There are some fascinating historical documentaries that are just as reverent and respectful as the tone of the film is. A lot of good footage here, featuring Gibson\'s thoughts, J.

The picture itself is very good, widescreen, and very effective in appearance.You may not agree with Gibson about his personal interpretations about the subject of Jesus all the time. But that\'s not the point in liking this film--for everything I thought was wrong with the film, Gibson has at least managed to present Jesus as a thoroughly ascetic hero, which goes a long way towards redemption for me, because today\'s family-oriented Christians want nothing to do with the pure ascetic life.

And, frankly, if the subject matter was not such a hallowed one, it is doubtful that Hollywood would have ever let it be made.  Mel Gibson has created this epic, depicting the last 12 hours of Christ\'s life on earth, as an act of faith.  Whether or not it is true to the gospels is for biblical scholars to decide. I\'m just a film buff, and a Jewish one at that, who was anxious to see the film because of all the buzz.O.K.  Acting and cinematography and marketing were all done well.  But this film is more than about those things.  It\'s about the central idea of the Christian faith.  And perhaps Christian viewers who saw this film were inspired.  I guess I naively thought that if I saw it I would come away with some insight about the central theme of Christianity.  That didn\'t happen.  Actually, I found the plot extremely difficult to follow and, with the exception of the 90% of the film devoted to the torture of Christ, it wasn\'t clear to me what was going on.  As a matter of fact, there were some parts that made me wonder if some of it was actually in the bible.For example, one of the early scenes shows Christ and a woman shortly before he is arrested.  I guess she\'s supposed to be the Satan or the forces of evil.  We\'re supposed to understand that she\'s a bad guy because there\'s a worm coming out of her nose and later there\'s a serpent springing at Jesus.  This woman shows up throughout the film, floating, instead of walking around, especially during the scenes where Jesus is being beaten.  This flogging is perhaps the longest part of the film.  And this is not a simple beating.  The cruel soldiers are large and laugh at his pain.  He is whipped first with sticks and then irons with cruel hooks on them.  His flesh is literally pulled from his body.  It goes on and on and on and on.  And the audience sees every stroke and every wound on his body over and over and over again in living color and in vivid close-ups.  Tears came to my eyes just from the horror and the suffering of it all.  And we hadn\'t even gotten to the crucifixion yet.The dialog was in Aramaic and Latin.  Some of it wasn\'t translated.  But it was clear that the soldiers, too, were the bad guys.  Maybe they were just doing their jobs.  But they were bad guys because they enjoyed it so much.The crowd of people who called for Jesus\' death were bad guys too.  I guess they were Jews.  But so were Jesus\' mother and all the disciples.  Judas who told the authorities where Jesus was hiding for 30 pieces of silver was also a bad guy.  But he got his comeuppance when he felt guilt and then was chased by a group of children whose faces turned to evil using the best of Hollywood\'s computer distortion techniques.It never was clear to me who was who and some of the plot confused me.  John was shown with Mary and kept calling her Mother.  If I didn\'t know better I would have thought that he was Jesus\' brother.  And again, if I didn\'t know better I would have though Mary Magdalene was Jesus\' sister until a short flashback showed her wearing long earrings and being saved by Jesus from being stoned to death.  It was also never really clear why the crowd wanted Jesus to die.One of the best roles, as written, was given to Pontius Pilate.  He, alone, had some choice in the matter.  Even the King, Herod, had found no crime that Jesus had committed.  So Pontius Pilate had a choice, as governor of the area, whether or not to condemn Jesus to death.  Here was a conflicted man who had to make a choice.  He gave in to the crowd though instead of following his own conscience.  And the way his scenes were written, it was understandable why he made that choice.Sooner or later, all that depiction of suffering becomes numbing.  I couldn\'t wait for the film to end.  And even though there were some brief flashbacks, I would have liked to see more about Jesus\' life, not his death.  Also, for someone without a Christian background I still don\'t understand why he had to go through all that suffering.  I also wonder if an earthquake really occurred at the moment of his death, splitting the palace in two and destroying a temple.  And I wonder if, by making this a Hollywood spectacular, this particular film didn\'t somehow take away from each believing Christian his or her own personal version of what actually happened.  Surely, the film it is a landmark that will forever be imbedded in people\'s minds as the actual truth.  However, it is in reality just one man, Mel Gibson\'s version of this most influential story in the Christian world.The Passion of the Christ is a disturbing film.  I hated watching the torture.  I felt uncomfortable not really understanding.  However, I did not come away with a feeling of it being anti-Semitic.  I would never ever recommend this film for children.  As for adults, however, I think it is an important film.  I hold back on recommending it to anyone though.

It is an excellent film with incredible artistic and realistic values often portrayed in all great epics, and is a must-see film for all!Despite the controversial anti-Semitic allegations, we held a special screening the day before the film\'s release nationwide, and invited many Jews.  All of them were extremely moved and emotionally distraught because they had no idea how horrific the crucifixion really was.  But, none of them felt the film was at all anti-Semitic.  One gentleman even stated that he could see how the Jewish religious leaders and many Jews were responsible for the literal suffering of Jesus, but he also took note that there were many other Jews portrayed in the film who were distraught over Jesus\' suffering and the brutality inflicted upon Him by the Romans.  He answered the allegations of anti-Semitism with this:  \\"You can\'t blame the entire race for the inflictions caused by a few...It would be like blaming every white person for the suffering of the black slaves during the Civil War era.  Not everyone can be responsible for the act of a few.\\"This movie is by far the most incredible and realistic depiction of Christ\'s last twelve hours, filled with incredible performances by Jim Caviezel and Mya Morgenstern, who portrays Jesus\' mother, Mary.  While the film\'s obvious focus is on those last twelve hours of Christ, Mel Gibson does an incredible job of also telling the story of Mary\'s heartbreak as she endures tremendous maternal suffering, following her son to the cross.  Every parent could completely relate to Mary\'s own suffering and how horrified she must have felt.On the darker side, an often forgotten character is added to the storyline as satan is introduced as the tempter in the Garden of Gethsemane and often appears during the suffering and torment of Christ, which is an interesting addition to the story.Overall, this film is definitely not for children under the age of 12, and parental discretion is absolutely advised.  But, be sure to purchase the DVD when it comes out and share it with those same children when they get older.

I wasn\'t prepared for the emotion \\"punch in the gut\\" that it deliveredThere were times when it took every fibre of my being not to cry my eyes out like some little child. As I sat transfixed in my seat, as the movie unfolded, the enormity of what this Man and his sacrifice entailed was almost too much to bear.I would respectfully disagree with those critics and viewers who felt the magnitude of the bloodshed and violence in this movie was excessive.I can recall the biblical films from my youth - The Greatest Story Ever Told, King of Kings - which depicted the last week of His life and particularily the crucifixion in a relatively \\"antiseptic\\" fashion.

Well, frankly I thought it was done very, very well. In fact, I think one of the more powerful scenes in the movie occured at the end - after Christ uttered \\"it is finished\\" on the cross and died - and we see the scene of Satan screaming as he realizes that Death and Sin have been conquered by this Man.

Because of these reasons, this movie has been portrayed in a most unfortunate light.Even if you are not religious, this is one of the most important stories ever told, and one of the most incredible uses of film.  It draws on historical first hand accounts and tells the story of the murder of a man who went against those in power and tried to spread the message of love.  Modern film has advanced to a point where the torture he endured can be accurately portrayed on film.  Don\'t let the violence blind you to the point of this film, that this man had a vision and was willing to withstand any pain in order to share it with the world.Mel Gibson has said that he drew from the eyewitness accounts collected in the Bible\'s New Testament, as well as the diaries of the Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich as collected in her book, \'The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\'.  Even if you are not a Catholic or a Cristian, everything in this movie has been supported as historically accurate by many secular academics.  It also draws from films such as \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" and others.The film was made with an eye towards accuracy and its realism is often difficult to watch because of the tortures Jesus endures.  All of the visual imagery serves a purpose, and shows us realistically just how much pain Jesus was willing to go through to fulfil what he saw as his destiny.The dialogue is in Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew with english subtitles.  Contrary to what other reviewers have suggested, these are not \\"dead\\" languages just yet, though aramaic and latin are only spoken in small enclaves of the world.  There are still populations that grow up speaking off-shoots of these languages.  I applaud the film-maker for boldly attempting to film this in the original languages of the time period portrayed.

Other films have been condemned, discussed, dissected and more. But this film has received more anger ridden controversy than the last movie about Christ to do so, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. And is the controversy worth noting? Perhaps. But some of it is nothing more than the rants of people who never saw the film. The film does deserve to be seen and discussed.For anyone living in a cave over the past few years, the movie focuses on the last day in the life of Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel). It opens with his praying on his last night in the garden and moves quickly forward to his betrayal by Judas and subsequent torture and persecution by anyone with power at the time.A sect of Jews led by Caiphas found Jesus to be a threat to their power base. In response, they set out to have him destroyed. More than destroying his following, they actually wanted him wiped off of the face of the Earth. And they set out to do so. This has caused some to consider the film anti-Semitic. The fact of the matter was there were two choices of the people involved to crucify Christ at that time: the Jewish leaders or the Roman leaders. History has shown that it was the Jewish leaders that called for his demise. Plus the fact is that Jesus himself was a Jew. It is not anti-Semitic to state this. It is merely history. And for those who believe, there was no other option for those leaders if God\'s plan was to be followed through.The movie proceeds to show the physical persecution of Jesus from there forward. When he is arrested and transported to the temple, he is beaten with the chains that bind him. When he is in the temple and accused, he is beaten by the mob. All of this is disturbing in its own right. But things get progressively worse.Taken to Pilate so that he might put Jesus to death, Pilate opts for the political ploy of sending him to Herod, the king of Jesus land of birth, to judge him. Herod sends him back. Pilate caves but not completely, ordering Jesus to be punished but not put to death. And this is where the truly brutal point of the film begins.Jesus is taken to the guards for scourging. For those who do not know, this is when Jesus was beaten. Many times we have heard about Jesus being whipped, lashed or beaten. But never has it been this graphically portrayed. The guards taunt Jesus and are presented as sadistic oafs. They begin with reed like canes and when that doesn\'t offer enough damage, when Jesus continues to rise, they switch to a cat-o-nine tails type whip, tipped with pieces of glass. These cut into Jesus\' flesh, ripping him apart like so much meat. When finished, the stones surrounding Jesus are covered in blood.Throughout the grueling punishment that Jesus receives, his mother Mary is witness. She sees the torturous treatment that her son receives. She sees the pain and anguish he is going through. And she conveys on her face the pain that she is suffering along with him.Near death, Jesus is once again taken to Pilate. Still unwilling to condemn this man to death, he turns the matter over to the people who call out for his demise. Broken and bloodied, Jesus is forced to carry his own cross to be crucified on. Shredded beyond belief, he does so, faltering several times along the way, at one point requiring assistance.The final act of the film offers perhaps the most realistic glimpse of what those who were crucified had to endure. It is painful to watch. Director Mel Gibson never lets go of the viewer\'s throat, forcing you to witness the pain that Jesus, Gibson\'s representation of God on Earth, went through. And it leaves you wasted by the film\'s end.There is no way that a person of faith, a person who believes in God and Jesus can walk away from this film untouched. The images are seared into your mind. Although I do not attend church, I believe in God and Jesus. And as I watched, beginning with the scourging, I found myself crying. Sure I had heard that people were doing this. I was prepared to control myself while watching. But as the film progressed, I cried several times, unable to stop and never feeling ashamed of it. This movie can affect you as strongly as this.From a technical standpoint, the movie is very well made. The photography is well done, the story told plainly and simply and the direction done so as to not make you notice. It was Gibson\'s passion with his belief in Christ that made this film a reality. He has taken much heat from the Hollywood community for bringing his vision to life. It has been said that he may never work in Hollywood again. If that were possible, it would be their loss, not his.The movie opened big, making more money than anyone could ever have expected by a movie of this sort of topic. It caused more discussion of religion and belief than any movie that I can ever recall. And perhaps, even though he has suffered the slings and arrows of an impartial press and industry, perhaps it was worth it. Because at the end of the day, Gibson was able to make people think once again about God. And that is an accomplishment in itself.I highly recommend that everyone see this film.

Never before in any movie have we seen one man take such a punishment. When Christ gets scourged by the roman soldiers it was the most intense scene i\'ve ever seen since Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. They scourged him to bad. The cuts they put on him would have made a man bleed to death. The march to Calvary with his cross was also a painful sight to watch. You continue to see him get beat brutally and the crowd throws stones at him. It was to long and those two scenes take up over an hour worth of filming. The crucifiction is also very intense. When they rip is shoulder out of place to stretch him on the cross so they can keep nailing him to it I cringed bad. I don\'t ever remember cringing like that. You see the nails go in him and you see the blood squirt out with each hit. It\'s rather intense and in my opinion way to much.The scariest aspect the movie didn\'t relate to is that the beating and Jesus dying on the cross was nothing to what he suffered in the garden. He sweat blood from all of his pores. In angel of the lord came to give him comfort and yet it still didn\'t. They show a little bit in the beginning, but you never get the idea in the movie that this man just atoned for the sins of the whole world. It\'s the sacrifice that Jesus made in the garden that has made it possible for us to live with him again.I didn\'t like how they put Satan in the movie. Never does it say anywhere in the gospels that Satan was there. It doesn\'t say he wasn\'t there, but he wasn\'t needed in the movie. He doesn\'t add anything to it except for a big creep factor to it. You don\'t want to be creeped out while witnessing a beating like the one Jesus gets. I could have done without so much Mary, but it was made by Cathloics and they have their own beliefs. I respect that and Mel Gibson did a good job of not trying to throw his ideas of religon at you. There was some Hollywood in the movie, but it is accurate.The movie was made well. The costumes look fantastic. The sets look great as well. They speak Hebrew and Latin and you get English subtitles. It adds to the movie well and it wouldn\'t be nearly as good without it.All the actors are great. A perfect cast was made for the movie. Jim Cavaziel is great as Jesus. He\'s very sincere with the part and he took it very serious. Everybody on the set did. I have a lot of respect for Jim. He did get scourged a couple of times and he did seperate his shoulder carrying the cross. He got hypothermia a couple of times as well. He lived the part. He wanted it to be great and his performance is.The movie really is pretty good. It does make you think about the sacrifice that Jesus made for us. They just made it to intense. Jesus did so much for us in his life. He had so many sermons and did so much. He loved us that he atoned our sins and gave his life for us. We should remember him more for his loving acts,not a big gigantic beating.The movie is intense and brutal. There were barely any dry eyes in our theater here. It definetly makes you think about what was done for us. It\'s not a jew bashing movie and it doesn\'t throw religon down your througt. It\'s not a movie for a younger audience, but it\'s definetly something that should be seen.If your going to learn about the last few hours of Christs life go to church and read your bible. Pray about it.

Gibson has done a fine, if imperfect, job of reimagining the final hours of Christ\'s life.The picture opens in the Garden of Gethsemane with Yeshua/Jesus (Jim Caviezel) praying, agonizing before the Father about what must happen next. A detachment of soldiers - led by Judas son of Simon Iscariot - arrives to arrest Jesus. The party then brings him before Annas and Caiaphas, some of the Sanhedrin, and finally Pilate who, following a very bloody scourging, gives in and hands him over to be crucified. (I especially appreciate the attempt to represent Pilate\'s own situation.) Jesus, mocked by many and abandoned by even his closest followers, forgives his executioners - a unique response to one\'s torturers when compared to the responses found in certain intertestamental martyrological texts, such as 2 Maccabees 7 and 4 Maccabees 9-12. The film makes interesting spiritual connections, periodically showing Satan to be tempting Jesus to \\"call it off\\" (even though I think the Gospels suggest demonic forces may have been trying to get Jesus killed - e.g. Luke 22:53; John 13:27-30). Following death, Jesus is lowered from the cross and prepared for burial, which process is not shown. Less than one minute of screen time is devoted to the Resurrection - the movie\'s final scene - in which the stone rolls away, the linen cloths sink to a formless pile, and a very-much-alive Jesus stands and strides out of the tomb.Mr. Gibson has made a bold statement of personal faith - faith not in some societal cause or abstract ideology, but in an individual of the historic past. A statement made despite often enormous unpopularity. Agree with his religious views or not, Mel Gibson is a man of great personal conviction and courage.I do think, the more attention one pays to THE PASSION\'s characters and their actions, the more clear it becomes that Gibson does not paint the Jewish people with a single brush. There is at least some variety in behavior on the part of the Jews and even the Romans. (It is also worth noting that most people who grow up \\"in the church\\" understand that someone professing similar faith who wants to \'tell the story\' on film does so NOT because he/she is anti-Semitic, but because he/she wants to be true to those biblical accounts.) On that note, I would have tried to cast more Middle-Eastern-looking persons for the role of Jesus and perhaps other Jews, to give it an even greater measure of authenticity.I would also have liked to see something in the way of special features on the DVD: the Making of the Passion, theatrical trailers, and the like (in fairness, however, Gibson may not have had the budget for all of that).For what it is, the movie serves as an intelligent and unapologetic portrayal with solid performances all around, especially by Caviezel. And ultimately, for the Christian, the tale of Yeshua\'s suffering and subsequent glorification - and all they involve - remains the most worthy-to-be-told story of this era ... and this film one of the most culturally and cross-culturally potent tools for evangelism I have ever seen or heard about.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mel\'s \\"Passion\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1100476800, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2004"}\n',

Christ is then turned over to Pontius Pilate before ultimately being handed over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.Mel Gibson\'s screenplay does a good job of sticking to the original story of the crucifixion as laid out by the Gospels.  He also deserves commendation for refusing to shy away from the torture of Christ that most other filmmakers have stayed away from when tackling this subject.  However, the elements of blood and gore steal the focus from the core message that the film attempts to deliver.The violence of the film is what most people come away talking about after seeing it, which is understandable since the film is almost entirely about violence.  The majority of the film focuses on the gruesome torture of Jesus, but it would not be fair to classify \\"The Passion\\" as the most violent film ever made.  War movies such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and even Gibson\'s Oscar winning epic \\"Braveheart\\" are just two of the many films that strike me as being much more violent than this film.However, if you do not possess a Christian understanding of the true \\"passion\\" of the Christ that Gibson is trying to depict, then you will likely come away from the theatre focused on nothing but the carnage.\\"The Passion\\" is a story of unconditional love and sacrifice.  It purposely focuses on Jesus\' torture and death in order to reflect Gibson\'s personal beliefs that Christ was indeed the Messiah who gave up his own life in order to offer the rest of humankind eternal salvation.  And unless you are aware of that message, this film will be nothing to you except a story about a man who is severely beaten and then executed.Many critics of the film have claimed that it promotes anti-Semitism, and this debate has been responsible for much of the attention that \\"The Passion\\" sparked even months before its opening.  However, Gibson has not in any way set out to promote anti-Semitism, and his film does no such thing.  The movie accurately depicts the villains of the story, who are made up of a group of Jewish politicians, some sadistic Roman soldiers, and a selfish governor who willingly condemns an innocent man to death in order to serve his own political interests.There are many excellent performances in this film, notably Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern as Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene.  However, Hristo Shopov steals the show as Pontius Pilate, who is forced to choose between his own beliefs and the pressures of his people in order to determine the fate of an innocent man.Rosalinda Celentano\'s character is one of the major liberties that Gibson takes with the script.  She does a convincing job of playing Satan, but she appears at very random parts of the film and seems to detract from the rest of the scene instead of adding anything to it.  (The fact that Gibson decided that Satan should look like Peter Jackson\'s depiction of Gollum in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is also a bit distracting.)Anyone who has a slight knowledge of Christian tradition will be moved by \\"The Passion.\\"  Those who do are not familiar with the story of the Gospels will be unable to grasp Gibson\'s message, and this film will be wasted on them.  Gibson has done an amazing job of transcending the story of Christ\'s ultimate sacrifice to the screen.  \\"The Passion\\" is the most accurate depiction of that story that has ever been made, and it should be admired for that, although it will ultimately have different impacts for people of different backgrounds.NOTE:  This film has an R rating, which I deem as appropriate.  There are many people clamoring about how \\"The Passion\\" should have been given a rating of NC-17 and that children have no business seeing this film.  Although I think that parents should take their child\'s individual needs into consideration before allowing them to see any movie, I witnessed many young children in attendance with their parents at the theatre, and they appeared to handle the movie without a problem.  Children who have been raised in a Christian environment will be familiar with the story of Christ\'s execution already, and parents may feel that the film is an excellent way to reinforce the story of Jesus\' sacrifice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brilliant, but misunderstood by most.", "unixReviewTime": 1085875200, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2004"}\n',

And most of these films, except for Martin Scorsese\'s \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" have been exceedingly reverent and unfortunately hokey: films that were made mostly to tap into a ready-made audience of the devout and purposely not meant to cause a stir and therefore ignoring what it was that made Jesus the revolutionary man that he was. A Man that was as conflicted about we humans as we are about ourselves.One of the best things about Mel Gibson\'s \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is that it shows Christ not only as a Spiritual man but as a man whose time on earth was spent as, not only a leader, but as a dedicated son, an expert craftsman and a kind and loving friend to his disciples. He was the ultimate human being after all and Gibson captures this side of Christ amazingly well.\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" also raises as many questions as it attempts to answer and this is on the plus side. But several things about it are too tame: the music for one is dreadful:  all soaring voices, and Middle Eastern doodling cheapens the effect of the visuals. The music should have been spare and lean, used mainly to quietly underscore the inherent drama of the story. Another minus is the use of Aramaic and Latin instead of English or some other modern language. Authentic or not, all this does is telescope the story away from us rather than bringing it as close to us as possible.The incessant brutalizing of Christ is graphic to say the least and even though I had to turn away from the screen on several occasions; I felt that the violence was ultimately cathartic and dramatically truthful. Remember this a film, after all: a drama based on the Bible and interpreted by Gibson and his screenwriter. The purpose of this film is to dramatize, i.e. tell its story in an effective, truthful and honest a manner as possible.The issues with Gibson using this story to primarily implicate the Jews as the primary assassins of Christ are ludicrous: they had a part because they felt Jesus was a threat but equally to blame was Pilate and most of the Romans and almost everyone else including Judas, Peter and Jesus himself. The only people that seemingly escape Gibson\'s blame are Mary and Mary Magdalene. In fact one of the most touching scenes in this film shows Mary placing her ear to a stone road to listen for her son\'s heartbeat as he hangs handcuffed to a pole below.\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is not perfect, but it is honest and caring and comes from a place of Love.

I was wrong!  Not only does the Aramaic work well and convincing but also the story was \\"fresh\\" and exciting.  Gibson does a super job of directing putting in some very scary scenes such as a snake that appears to come from a demon and having some children turn demonic and attack Judas.As Jesus is beaten by sadistic and unfeeling Romans, the populace look on including his mother.  You feel her pain as the torturers flay him to a point that you wonder if he has any skin left.  Throughout the beatings there are some very nice flashbacks, showing Jesus in happy times with his mother, making a table for her.The only drawback to the movie is the part when Jesus is made to drag his cross to the crucifixion site.  Gibson seemed to drag that part out almost 30 minutes.  It is quite interesting that a man is forced to help Jesus carry his cross and the man seems to have more difficulty than Jesus even though Jesus is a bloody mess all over his body.The movie seems to place the main blame on the Jewish priest Kyfus who seems to be obsessed with seeing Jesus die for going against Kyfus\'s teachings.  Kyfus spurs the Jewish crowd to demand that Jesus be crucified.Like anything Biblical, we will never know what is the truth and what is someone\'s interpretation.

Concerning o the negative media hype, we did not come out of the theater with a sense of hatred for Jews, Romans, or anyone else.  Quite the contrary - my wife was moved to tears several times, and while I did not cry, I certainly gained an even greater appreciation of what Jesus Christ did for us!Yes, the movie did contain some of the Hollywood creativity you see in movies based on actual stories (did Jesus really stomp on a snake in the Garden of Gethsemane, and some other instances), but the movie was faithful to the biblical account of Jesus\' death for the sins of the world and the Hollywood creativity  did not detract from the film\'s essence.  The film\'s setting (I think it was filmed somewhere in Europe) and atmosphere were also very powerful.While some people have problems with the movie\'s violent content (some people left the theater early when we went), Jesus\' death was extremely violent.  Since Jerry Springer can let skeletons come out family closets and Hollywood can produce movies full of illicit sex, foul language, and mind-numbing violence, then why should a portrayal of the crucifixion be sanitized? The viewer\'s emotions are aroused and the person is challenged to really think about what he or she believes in terms of Jesus Christ and His claims. In short, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do and is much more than just mere Hollywood entertainment.The only complaint I have with the movie is the emphasis on the crucifixion and not enough on the resurrection.  Of course, if Mel Gibson produces a sequel on Christ from the resurrection to His ascension, then this complaint is irrelevant (and I hope so too).For the Christian:  see the movie or buy or rent the dvd and be encouraged that you have a present and future hope in Jesus Christ!For the non-Christian:  expect to be aroused emotionally and  challenged intellectually about what you believe concerning  Jesus Christ and Who He said He was and is!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Inspirational Movie of Hope for All!", "unixReviewTime": 1088812800, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2004"}\n',

She accurately portrayed the love and sorrow that Mary felt for her son. There are two things about this film that might be confusing to the average movie-goer. The first is that the film showcases the last 12 hours of Jesus\'s life starting with the betrayal of Judas and ending with the crucifixtion. For those who don\'t know the history behind Jesus, it might be a tad bit confusing because there is no backstory. Mel Gibson did this because he wanted to focus on the most powerful and disturbing part of Jesus\'s life. The second is with the character Satan. You see Satan throughout the film, but it is never really made clear who he is. To the average person, he justs looks like one of the crowd dressed in black.

He emphasizes the torture and persecution of a prophet and brutality and prejudice of his tormentors without shedding any light on the mission of the prophet.

The movie also portrays the Romans to be more civilized than the Jews of those days for their resistance to punish a poor man for his beliefs.The movie widens the gap between Christianity and other religions, one for reducing a holly prophet to the level of an insane man, and two for stressing on the common obsession among Christians of the person of the prophet instead of his deeds, mission, and wisdom. All Muslims believe that their prophets (including Jesus, Ibraham, Moses, and Muhammad) died as men like the rest of us and only their missions will remain alive because of its applicability to everyday matters.

The movie is said to fail in not focusing on Jesus\'s life and his great moral teachings -the things that everyone can find agreement with. Mr Gibson is personally attacked as a religous wacko from the dark ages - that is, he literally believes the Christ myth, rather than taking the enlightened view that it is all a metaphor for the changing of the seasons- dark aspersions are cast upon him for his refusal to publicly rebuke his 85 year old father. In short, the typical review has taken a stern, one might almost say, puritanical, stance against violence in the cinema, and has attempted to instruct the Christians in the doctrines of Christianity while simultaneously (unconsciously or otherwise) rejecting them.I think it would be unfortunate if this movie were to become some sort of acid test for Christian belief. Undoubtedly, there are critics, who, for matters of personal taste or some other reason, will simply find this film unnappealing. These I think, though, are the relativly small minority. I believe that the rest of the film\'s negative critacism can be divided into two groups; those who openly and knowingly contest Christianity (a surprisingly small portion of this film\'s negative reviews come from those who plainly admit this), and those who simply have a quite egregiously poor understanding of what it means to be a Christian.With respect to the second group, they generally take the position that Christ was, first and foremost, a great moral teacher, and that Mr. Gibson has seriously erred in not concentrating on this aspect of his life. This position is a half truth, at best, I believe. There have been many great moral teachers, and, to a surprising degree, they have taught the same thing. Whether it was Plato or Confucius, we would doubtlessly all of us be much the better if we followed their teachings. We can\'t -at least none of us can very well or very consistently- that is the whole point. Chrisitianity is the most pragmatic of religions, it is the only one that knows man will fail. Even the very best among us make atrocious mistakes; we all wrong ourselves, each other and God in and to a quantity and degree that is simply unforgivable. If this were not so then the passion would have been unnecessary. Without the passion, Christianity is meaningless.To look at the \\"moral teacher\\" assertion from another angle, it is merely wrong. Most people, even non-Christians, accept that the words of Jesus are those of a great moralist. But what other great moralist claims to be mankind\'s saviour? To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, this leaves us with few options. We can accept that Jesus is who he claims to be, or else we must come to the conclusion that he is a raving lunatic, or, indeed, something much worse than that.There is, behind all this, this desire to have Christ without the cross, an unwillingness and a distinct discomfort towards accepting human nature for what it has become. After all, at some times, on some levels, I\'ve probably convinced myself that I was basically a decent guy. Most of us really are more good than we are bad, aren\'t we? No, actually, we aren\'t -a history book, or even an honest self examination ought to make that readily and abundantly clear. Every earthly, utopian scheme mankind has cooked up or ever will,  breaks on his own nature. The modern person has no difficulty with Christ as a hippy, who sings Broadway songs about love and peace. The Christ who died an excruciating death so that our sins might be cleaned -the idea that this modern person might have any sins that cannot be cleansed with an honest apology or a card and flowers. Or, to go even farther, the idea that sin is anything more than an antiquated human invention(!) - seems to have a puzzling, rather infuriating effect on our hypothetical modern person.This review is getting quite long, but I\'d like to write a couple more personal thoughts on the movie before I finish.I should maybe say, as regards myself, that I was raised a very nominal Lutheran. I was for a long while an agnostic with a rather low opinion of Christians. It was only after reading  Plato\'s Socratic dialougues that I was able conceive an understanding of God that made any sense to me, and it\'s only been even more recently yet that I\'ve come to reconcile that understanding with Christianity. In short, I must admit, it is a rather airy, conceptualized faith that I hold to.There is one image from this film that remains in my mind days after viewing. Christ stands mutilated, wearing the crown of thorns, looking out into the leering crowd. Here the expression is simultaneously of mute defiance and acceptance; he stands as the living truth, in defiance of man, what man has become and what man will yet do, and in acceptance of what He must do. Mr. Gibson\'s film was, to me, the first clear, visceral view of something I believe I\'ve felt and understood in only a fleeting way. With regards to this, to again paraphrase Mr. Lewis, I cannot help but feel that there is such a thing as getting more than you bargained for.This is a relentless, brutal film, and that is maybe the one thing which everyone who sees it will agree on. Mr. Gibson has shown no mercy to his audience; he ignores their culture, the age they live in, their sensibilities, even their language in attempting to present the truth. By making a movie that is superficially alien and unspecific to any group of people, he has made a film that is equally universal to all. Wheras church leaders today stress the importance of making the faith accessible, Mr. Gibson is clearly more concerned with persuading people to make themselves accesible to the timeless and unchanging truth. I walked away from the film convinced that this was it\'s end and final artistic goal, and God bless you for it, Mr. Gibson.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No milk and water for Mr. Gibson", "unixReviewTime": 1080000000, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2004"}\n',

It opened in theaters back in February, but I didn\'t watch it until just this weekend.  I had heard all the press coverage about just how horrible and graphic the scenes of Jesus\' torture and crucifixion were, and felt more than a little uneasy about the thought of viewing it myself.  I was expecting the absolute worst, so to some extent I guess it wasn\'t as bad as I thought it would be.  Still, there has never been (nor likely again will be) such a realistic and gut-twisting depiction of our Lord\'s sufferings on behalf of fallen men.As a committed follower of Jesus, I found the entire story to be both familiar in one sense, i.e., I know the gospel accounts of Jesus\' trial and execution, while in another sense it provided new and fresh insights into events that I previously could only visualize in my imagination.  This additional dimension to the story can only add to my (and every other true believer\'s) level of love and worship for Jesus and what he did for me.  When I was at church yesterday, I was immediately enthralled during the worship time as images from this movie were firmly fixed in my mind.I would urge every Christian to view this film soberly and with a great deal of reflection on just what an awful price was required to pay the penalty for our sins.  And bear in mind that the physical torture paled in comparison to the horrific spiritual punishment that God the Father heaped on Jesus in that terrible moment of judgment.  Only after the physical sacrifice was accompanied by the spiritual judgment of sin could Jesus say \\"It is finished.\\"  If we take this to heart, we would not be nearly so complacent or cavalier in our attitudes toward our sin or obedience to the revealed will of God.  What a wake-up call!My only criticisms are these:  first, although by and large Jim Caviezel played his role marvelously, there were several scenes where he simply gave in to melodrama.  In my mind this diminished the overall impact of the film.  Second, I was troubled by Mel Gibson\'s injection of certain details that are not recorded in scripture, but are merely matters of Catholic tradition -- for example, the towel with the bloody imprint of Jesus\' face.  My problem with this isn\'t that I\'m a protestant, it\'s that when Mel Gibson does such things he departs from the scriptural account and takes license that I believe is unjustified in portraying this event.  The bulk of the film is quite true to the biblical record, and I just wish Mel had kept it that way for the whole.My final critique, and probably the most important, is that I would have liked to have seen this story set in the context of a fuller presentation of the gospel account, rather than limit the surrounding narrative to a series of limited flashbacks.  A person who approaches this film without a certain familiarity with the gospels will have a hard time piecing together just why Jesus had to suffer and die as he did, and just what his death accomplished.  The most striking illustration of the need for broader context is the scene where Mary Magdalene is saved from stoning.  Not a word is spoken in that scene, and thus it is unlikely that someone who hasn\'t read John chapter 8 would understand what is going on in this scene.Overall, I think Mel Gibson did a wonderful job in telling this story, insofar as he chose to portray it.  Notwithstanding all the controversy, the rejection by the Hollywood establishment, and the cries of antisemitism, I have no doubt that this movie is destined to be one of the all-time greats.  The marketplace has already vindicated Mel Gibson, and I trust that the Lord will use this film for the advancement of his kingdom.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A reality check for complacent Christians.", "unixReviewTime": 1084752000, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2004"}\n',

Randall", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "John 3:16:  \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have eternal life\\".For many years, I knew of that passage in the bible and even superficially understand what it meant.  It wasn\'t until I saw the movie, \\"The Passion\\" that I truly felt and internally understood what verse signified.  Now, I will never forget its meaning.  There has never been a more graphic and vivid visualization of the God love for humankind by sacrificing his only son so that we should have see Heaven.  Director Mel Gibson\'s powerful and striking work of devotion is one of the most remarkable and memorable motion pictures I have ever seen.  In telling the story of the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ, Gibson crafts an epic that is both brutal and touching.  No on who sees this movie will be same after watching it.Any film that attempts to tackle such a sensitive issue as the suffering (also known as `passion\') and crucifixion of the Son of God is bound to stir up tremendous controversy.  Mel Gibson certainly did that with his decision to tell the story of \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".  \\"The Passion\\" was slammed in Jewish circles for being anti-Semitic and slammed in many other circles for being overly violent.  The outcry was so great that Gibson was forced to distribute this film on his own because no major studio would touch it.  The controversy, itself, is mostly without justification.  The fears of the film being anti-Semitic are unfounded.  The movie does not condemn Jewish people for the actions of a few of their priests (Caiphas, most notably) in the death of Christ anymore than it condemns the Roman people for Pontius Pilate\'s weak and indecisive role in the crucifixion.  It\'s the priests are to be condemned for their petty fearfulness.  The Jewish people are shown to be quite sorrowful over the torture and death of Christ.  The story, itself, is core to the origins of Catholic and Christian faith.  Its existence is canon.  Only misinterpretations in telling the story can cause ill will.  \\"The Passion\\" is derived almost completely from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Thus, it avoids that mistake.The criticisms pertaining to the overt violence of the film, while not baseless, are overstated.  There is no doubt that \\"The Passion\\" is an extremely violent film and certainly not suitable for young children or faint of heart.  However, there is nothing gratuitous or sensational about the violence.  The scene of the scourging of Christ is one of the most difficult to sit through, but it is honest in its depiction of the brutality of the centurions of the Roman Empire.  The graphic violence, torture and beatings are necessary so that the audience can truly empathize (and even sympathize) with the suffering Christ went through for our sins.Controversy notwithstanding, \\"The Passion\\" is amazing in its story structure and imagery.  While primarily telling of the last twelve hours (events known to Christians the Stations of the Cross and a time known as Good Friday), Gibson uses small visual cues to segue into flashbacks of Jesus\' life, thereby increasing the impact of the crucifixion by increasing the understanding of the greatness of this man.  Such events as the Last Supper, the drawing of the line in the sand to protect Mary Magdelene, and the famous Sermon on the Mount are shown with such touching detail that audience feels deeply for this man.  Even chorological events like Judas\' betrayal of Jesus and Peter\'s denial of Jesus three times are emotionally gripping.While the scourging may be the most brutal aspect of the film, the events after Christ is put on the cross at Calvary are the most heart-wrenching.  Actor Jim Caviezel does a spectacular job of embracing Christ\'s suffering while still showing his goodness and caring for others.  When Jesus speaks to the good thief, one can feel overwhelmed.  The other performances in this film are equally as stunning as Caviezel\'s.  Maia Morgenstern captures the grief a mother feels as Mary watches her only son be put to death.  The luminous Monica Bellucci also shows tremendous emotion as Magdelene, a woman who owes her life to the benevolence of Christ, yet is powerless to help him.  Even Bulgarian actor Hristo Shopov effectively captures the conflict and indecision of Pilate.\\"The Passion of The Christ\\" is as astounding a cinematic achievement as has ever been brought to the big screen.  It has been over a month since I saw it and it still dominates my thoughts.  I said that no one who sees this film will ever been same afterwards.

He dedicated his life to serving God the Father and mankind by God\'s will. He was and is perfect.But we can never be. Never again, will another walk upon the earth who is sinless, blameless and perfect as Jesus is. Jesus Christ, God\'s one and only beloved son, given as a sacrifice to redeem mankind and save us from ourselves. God\'s ultimate love offering given because He loves us so. Jesus came for exactly this, that we may be saved, have a new life more abundant here and eternal life with Him in God\'s kingdom. Yes, he taught us and lived as the living example of what we all should aspire to be, but also to do what none of us could not do for ourselves. Pay the debt for our sins.Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that gives us the most accurate recreation of the Lord\'s passion and suffering that has ever been seen. Combining the descriptions in the New Testament\'s gospels along with the Old Testament\'s prophecies of the Lord and the historical depictions of Roman punishment and torture devices, we\'re able to see what the Lord most likely really endured. No question, this film is brutal, but it must be. If not, we only take away the truth in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable. I\'ve seen many a violent film in my time but I found myself cringing more here than any of those. Not because I\'ve never seen worse but because this is what the Savior did for us. It should\'ve been us taking the beatings, the floggings and the crucifixion. That was our punishment placed upon the holy and innocent Son of God.\'The Passion\' focuses on the last days of Jesus\' life here on earth. From the opening, we find him on the Mount of Olives, as the sins of the world are being placed upon him. As the cold, hard reality of the pain and suffering that he is about to endure for a people by large that reject him. But his love and dedication to The Father being so great, he remains committed and fulfills his purpose. He allows himself to be unjustly arrested and convicted of a crime he did not commit. Then handed over to the Romans to be scourged, tortured and ultimately put to death for the love of The Father and every one of us who\'s sins he bore. As it is written, \\"greater love has no man that he who lay down his life for his friends\\".But all of this would be in vain and just be a sad story had he not risen from the grave. If He were He just a man with some crazy ideas. But He did rise and is Lord and friend to all His people, to all God\'s children, while extending His invitation to all those who would receive Him. But contrary to popular belief, we are not all God\'s children. We are all God\'s creations but not until we are born again by grace through faith, confession and repentance in the Lord Jesus Christ, are we God\'s children. Jesus said, \\"unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God\\", and \\"I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but by me\\". And so it is. Our sins must be dealt with. And so they were, on the shoulders of the Lord when he died on the cross, shedding his precious blood for us.This movie brought people to question, who\'s to blame? Is it the Jews fault, or the Romans, or all of us? In a way, all three are true. We are all responsible. He paid the price for our sins, our debt. We all had a hand in it. But it was also the greatest demonstration of love ever shown. The Father\'s great love and the love of the Lord.Some complain that the film is too focused on the suffering and doesn\'t show the events leading up to this point, the miracles and the relationships. I understand that but theres only so much time to do it. There is a scene though, in a flashback, where Jesus is building a table and you see a playful sweetness between him and his mother Mary. It\'s touching and I wanted to see more of that but there are other films that give us more of His life. I recommend \'Jesus of Nazareth\' in what I believe is the most compelling and accurate telling. But this film had to stay focused. It too had a mission and purpose. To bring us to face what God the Father and the Jesus Christ did for us. So we could face the reality of it and of ourselves and I believe it succeeds. Many peoples lives were changed with this movie. Many people came to believe and we\'re saved. Many saved had fallen away and recommitted their lives to the Lord. Others were inspired to reflect and give thanks for the wonderful gift given to us. I know I did. I loved the fact that it got people talking. It got people thinking and discussing. It was on the T.V. and in the papers. People who would never otherwise talk about Jesus were and many who would never go to see such a film did. It was a wonderful time and a credit to the film.The dvd gives us a lovely period looking picture. Lots of browns and muted colors to show the age and make it believable. The print is clean and virtually free of blemish. The audio and score are very good. The dialog is in ancient hebrew with subtitiles which gives it a serious realism and isn\'t distracting. A very satisfying disc.In closing, \'The Passion\' is a wonderful film. It\'s an undenialble message that will force the viewer to take a stand on what they believe or don\'t believe. There is no middle ground. And that\'s a huge accomplishment for a film, to do what it did. Mel Gibson has become a very accomplished director and it all shows here. Many criticize him even to this day for comments he made while intoxicated. People have used it as a chance to bash him and this movie. But as Jesus said, \\"let he who is without sin, cast the first stone\\". We\'ve all said and done things that weren\'t right and have no right to rake another over the coals for it. He\'s human after all, just like the rest of us and just as we wish to be forgiven for our own sins, we should forgive him. He made a wonderful film that I suggest anyone and everyone watch with the exception of small children as there is alot of blood and violence that\'ll no doubt be scary to them. Parents, please use discretion and view it first. Jesus offers his invitation for salvation to everyone from all cultures and beliefs. All are welcome and no one will be turned away.

As a cinematic achievement, it is nothing short of brilliant: photography, music and, particularly, editing. Gibson\'s vision was sincere, and it has shone true, blindingly! Historically, one must remember that the Romans were in control of the area; they thought the Jewish patriarchs were a silly bunch of fanatics, and pretty much left them alone. So much so, that when threatened by Christ\'s ideology, one that would threaten the power they held over the majority, they had to eliminate the threat. Neither Pilate nor Herod wanted to be bothered, so they let the elders have their way. This is not an anti-Semitic depiction. Rather, the \\"reigning\\" majority found necessity in eliminating a threat to their very existance. This has happened throughout most recorded history. To call Gibson an anti-Semite is absurd. I found this to be historically accurate, without prejudice, and a brutal and honest display of those times (as well as we could imagine it). The Romans were portrayed as a bunch of mean drunks.

When I was a bartender, I learned that the two things you never discuss are religion and politics, because no two people will ever agree.

I am coming into this with the perspective of a non-believer, someone who thinks of the story of Jesus as a myth borrowed from other religions (any book on Mithras will show you parallels to stories that existed long before the supposed time of Jesus, for example). I took the movie as a work of fiction. I\'m not sure whether that brought me into it with a predisposition against the film, or with a more jaded eye, or what have you. But what I expected from the film was an ultraviolent piece of, to be short, propaganda.I should have known better, on both counts.The Passion is a profound, deeply moving piece of work. It is also not the violencefest I was expecting given Gibson\'s warnings to that effect; it was less Flower of Flesh and Blood than it was Saving Private Ryan. The violence is concentrated (in this case, in the final forty-five minutes of the film, from the thirty-nine lashes, with its strong shades of Peter Greenaway\'s The Baby of Macon, to Jesus\' death), but is in most cases more implied, with the aftereffects shown, than it is depicted. In other words, it\'s more film than it is endurance test. You\'ll probably want to leave the kids at home, but put your mind at ease. If you can make it through a Schwarzenegger flick, you\'ll get through this (and if you\'ve seen anything by Takashi Miike or Hideshi Hino, you\'ll coast through it wondering what all the fuss was about).No need for a plot summary, but just in case: The Passion is a biopic about the final twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ. Jesus is played by Jim Caviezel (Frequency, The Count of Monte Cristo). I\'d always rather thought of him as a second-rate hack, but his performance here is wonderful; rather like Willem Dafoe fifteen years ago, it\'s likely Caviezel will ride this Oscar-worthy performance into an excellent career. Everyone else in the film is pretty much a supporting actor, but a number of them support quite nicely; special mention should be given to Satan (Rosalinda Cantano, last seen in American cinemas in The Order), who\'s always creeping around the edges of things looking satisfied with the proceedings, and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, a staple in really bad B horror films like Octopus, Alien Hunter, and Python 2), both of whom also have the potential to get into really good movies after this.Much has been made of the film\'s supposed anti-Semitic content. I\'m pretty sure the majority of the people who see this film will come out of it wondering where, exactly, that anti-Semitic content is. The Jews are at best minor characters in this film, with the exception of Caiaphas (Mattia Spragia, also recently seen in The Order), who does most of the shouting. The real bad guys here are the Roman guards. For some reason, though, I haven\'t heard anyone crowing about anti-Italian discrimination in the movie. Huh. Go figure.Caviezel, Gibson, and executive producer Enzo Sisti (the producers are the guys who take home the Best Picture trophy) are all likely to walk off with Oscars in February 2005, and deservedly so, but they will still have to defeat competition. Where the film is going to lord it over (no pun intended) the rest of the films released in 2004 is in the fields of sound design, cinematography, and makeup. Caviezel spends the last forty-five minutes of the film being beaten into rapid deterioration, and the makeup guys actually manage continuity. (They mess up once at the very beginning of the film, but we\'ll forgive them for that.) The whole thing is beautifully shot, from opening scene to closing, with incredible attention paid to light and sound details. This is the kind of filmmaking you\'d get if Hideo Nakata (Ringu, Chaos) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks) got together and had a kid, who then married the greatest cinematographer on the planet, David Eggby (Mad Max, Pitch Black), and then THEY had a kid. There isn\'t a mote of light out of place in this movie. Anywhere. There\'s not a scene over- or underlit, not a sound too loud or too soft. (Another reason to watch this on the big screen; the sound balance here just begs for desecration when it gets transferred to DVD, as happens to so many films.) Simply put, this is the best light and sound work I have ever seen in a film. It\'s better than Pitch Black, better than Chaos, better (okay, by a nose) than Begotten. This is a movie that will make kids leave the theater and say \\"I want to be a cinematographer/sound designer when I grow up.\\" Yeah, it\'s that good. The effects are in the realm of those foreign directors whose work is ineligible for nomination here in America, but routinely do work far beyond anything we\'ve seen here: Takashi Miike, T. F. Mous, Hideshi Hino, Hideo Nakata, Kei Fujiwara. These are folks who know gore. They employ the top dogs in the Japanese and Hong Kong film industries to get it. They\'re going to start calling Christien Tinsley, the head make-up guy from Jim Caviezel, when they start making films in the west. Tinsley may not be a household name now, but he was also the head make-up guy for Eddie Murphy in Nutty Professor II and the overseer of How the Grinch Stole Christmas; expect this guy to be mentioned in the same breath as Tom Savini and Rick Baker within the next few years.In any case, whether you believe the story or not, this is definitely a film to be seen.

Granted, when the credits rolled I was laughing, but not for the reason you think.Think about it!What director and actor Mel Gibson (\\"Braveheart\\") has done is nothing short of mesmerizing and laudable: he has pulled together what amounts to a TWO HOUR snuff film involving no less than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Mystery made Flesh, the King of Kings, Emmanuel, meaning \\"God is with Us\\".Think about that for a second. I\'ll be here when you get back. Seriously, it takes wee kegs of steel to make a snuff film with JC.Awright, for those who don\'t know, \\"Passion\\" is all about the final 12 hours of JC, referred to as the \\"Stations of the Cross\\" by Catholics: we follow Jesus from Gethsemane, where he\'s praying (wait...he\'s God...who is he praying to? I\'m confused...nah, never mind) all the way to Golgotha, and on the way JC does a whole heap of dying.I\'m not kidding. That\'s what the film is about. Now, I know a ton of Christians---including Mel---who will argue until they\'re blue in the face that this is about Christ\'s suffering, and what He did for us. And yeah, for sure, it\'s about his suffering, alright. But that doesn\'t quite grasp the nature of the beast, if you\'ll allow me the license.It\'s not about the message of Christ. It\'s not about belief. It\'s not about miracles, or God, or mercy---it\'s about a 1st century AD Jew being folded, spindled, and mutilated by the Romans and their Jewish subjects---and when they get done folding, spindling, and mutiliating him, mind ya, they\'re just getting going.You\'ve got beating, gouging, flaying alive, flesh ripping, spear-thrusting, thorn of crowns head ripping! And to top it off, when the blood can\'t run any thicker or redder, the Romans get bored and nail JC to the cross. Sissies.Now, I\'m an action guy, so this is where \\"Passion\\" lost a star. I got tired of the sissy Romans and Pharisees picking on Jesus. After a while, you think---if there is a God, a *just* God, he would give his Son full permission to jump down off the Cross and do a little \\"Raiders of the Last Arc\\" number on his executioners. But no, doesn\'t happen, no spoiler here---we don\'t get a happy ending; JC believed in peace, which is why I ain\'t a Christian.What we *do* get, though, is gore. Oh, and gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (who did the camera-work for \\"Being There\\" and \\"The Patriot\\", among many other flicks), solid acting by all the players (James Caviezel as JC made me actually *want* to believe), including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, the whore. That was a stretch for her, I\'m sure. Oh, and we get Latin and Aramaic as the *only* languages available (don\'t worry morons, subtitles). Sweet.In the end, twisted, unwashed, heathen, stinking unbeliever that I am, I sorta enjoyed \\"Passion of the Christ\\". I\'m big into gore: I love splatter, love the sicko films of H.G. Lewis, love the Japanese gore \\"Guinea Pig\\" flicks, you name it. Basically, this was a snuff/gore/splatter flick with the Son of God as its subject, which, again---well, that\'s pretty ballsy, Mr. Gibson!We don\'t get the Resurrection (think of the Special Effects on that one, baby!). We don\'t get any sex scenes, which at least Martin Scorcese threw into his JC film. We also don\'t get any cool battle scenes, but I guess that\'s to be expected (someone---Ah-nold, mebbe? or Stallone?---should have shown up to rescue Jesus). Anyway, this film is like life: raw, brutal, nasty, pathetic, ultimately pointless. But it\'s still worth checking out, cochise, if only to see how a true Man (JC) faces death. You\'d whine and cry like a baby. He didn\'t. Street creds, man.It also helped that I saw \\"Passion\\" as a double feature with \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (2004 remake). Seeing the one after the other made it seem like, you know, a sequel. We didn\'t get the Resurrection, but Christ *does* rise from the Dead, and so by the time 2004 rolled around, everyone was infected. In that light, JC was the O.Z.

This movie, filmed with a degree of authenticity that has been praised by Christians world-wide, and clouded with as much contoversy, is by far the most brutal, most devastating, and indeed, the most powerful depiction of Jesus Christ\'s path to the cross.Filmed in Aramaic and Latin, the genuineness of this movie is almost unquestionable.  It focuses on the Scripture found in the new testament of the bible, specifically those chapters of the gospel that deal with the arrest, scourging and crucifixition of the Christ.  Opening in the garden of Gethsemane, the movie shows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, and follows the brutal suffering of Jesus when he is arrested by the Jewish Pharasees and later handed over to Pontius Pilate and the Roman army where he is brutally scourged and beaten down in a sequence that is heart-wrenching as much as it is brutally, graphically violent.  Many sequences in this film are shown in flash-back, including the Last Supper, when Christ shares the first eucharist with his apostles, and teaches that he is the \\"bread of life.\\"  The movie\'s climax centers around Jesus\'s crucifixition and death on the cross.Although many critics have admonished that this film is not for the faint of heart, I would like to suggest that this movie comes at a time when faith seems to waiver.  For my own part, I found that the film moved me on a very personal level, and left me weeping, not out of horror, but out of the immensely powerful message that Christ died for.  Ultimately, this is a film that serves not as entertainment, but as a healthy reminder that Christ died on the cross for our sins, that man might be spared.Although some critics have argued that the film is anti-Semetic, I would counter that the film is anything but.  Remember that Christ was a Jew, as were his apostles.  Further, Simon, who is pulled by Roman officers out of the crowd to help Christ carry his cross when his own battered body can no longer support it, he shows Christ mercy, standing against the Roman gaurds when they begin to beat him.  The depiction of mercy is present, even in the horror of Christ\'s crucifixition.Be warned that, though this film may arguably be the most honest and accurate depiction of Christ\'s passion ever, it may not be appropriate for younger audiences.  It is violent, and full of acts of human horrors that, though historically accurate, may be distrubing to younger viewers.That said, this film, in this reviewer\'s very humble opinion, should be seen by the masses.  It is profoundly moving and very inspiring.

Five stars, the top ranking, transaltes to \\"I Love It!\\"  It\'s hard to believe that anyone can watch this movie and have an \\"I Love It!\\" reaction.  Having just viewed the movie for the first time, I can attest that Gibson and team have made an amazing, top-notch film, but it\'s also a movie that I don\'t want to see again for quite some time.\\"The Passion,\\" appropriately titled, focuses primarily on Jesus\' (played with phenomenal range and conviction by Jim Caviezel) last 12 hours of life -- from the betrayal of Judas to his death on the cross.  Completely abandoning the sugary-sweet pablum of so many \\"traditional\\" religious movies, \\"The Passion\\" shows its characters as real-world men and women living in a hard-scrabble real world . . . raggedy beards, threadbare clothes, poverty, and none of the benign halos of self-knowing holiness that plague other depictions of Christ.  We get some flashbacks to isolated scenes, such as the Last Supper, some of Jesus\' lectures, and poignant shots of Jesus as a child and also working as a carpenter.  But these incidents are short interventions in an otherwise streamlined narrative.Jesus\' betrayal by Judas is followed by aspects of Jesus\' story that are largely unknown to Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter.  A \\"trial\\" by Jewish elders is followed by handing Jesus over to the Romans, who punt Jesus back to Herod for judgment (Pontius Pilate being savvy enough to avoid this hot potato).  But Jesus ends up back before Pilate and the elders demand the death of Jesus, whom they see as a dangerous rabble-rouser who is undermining centuries of holy teaching.The movie then turns to its most notorious aspects -- the torture and execution of Jesus.  While the gore is unrelenting, this is not mindlessly handled by Gibson and his team.  The extent of Jesus\' suffering for mankind is the precise point of the story, and it is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected.  This is a movie that brings Jesus\' sacrifice home in the most powerful of ways -- by showing in graphic fashion how much the man endured and still managed to ask for man\'s forgiveness, \\"for they know not what they do.\\"This is a movie of powerful performances and visual artistry . . . for all its horrors, \\"The Passion\\" is a beautiful film.  The soundtrack is also understated, yet important - the few times I noticed it, I was moved.  And the special effects are perhaps too good - the violence unleashed on Jesus\' body never looks cartoonish or unrealistic.I\'ll leave it to others to debate the charges of anti-semitism that arise from \\"The Passion.\\"  As a relatively uninformed observer, the movie appears balanced to me -- most of the Jewish elders demand Jesus\' death (although there are a couple of elders who question this, but they are shouted down), but there are plenty of other Jews in the movie who decry what they see -- the problem is that they are outside the local power structure.  All in all, it doesn\'t come across as an anti-semitic movie unless one starts with the proposition that the movie tells an anti-semitic story.Few movies qualify as \\"important\\" in my book, but this one is right up there with Spielberg\'s two WWII movies, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Schindler\'s List,\\" as well as other flicks like \\"The Accused,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Mississippi Burning,\\" and \\"Ghandi.\\"  These movies generally aren\'t easy to watch, but they tell stories that I should know better, and they tell the story so well that it is seared into my brain.  \\"The Passion\\" is an unforgettable masterpiece -- it may be a couple of years before I feel the need to watch it again, but I\'m sure that I\'ll remember every scene.A must-see.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Astounding, Gut-Wrenching, Moving, Difficult Film", "unixReviewTime": 1116201600, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2005"}\n',

You probably should not have seen it since you are clearly unable to grasp the truth of His message.)That said, I will not lower myself again to the same level as other reviewers who attack differing personal spiritual views as a means to criticize the film - I can only suppose it is because they are threatened by the message.

I was totally blown away by the depth of love and kindness that Jesus has shown us by going to the cross.  You can read other reviews to hear about synopsis and cinematography, for me this movie accurately portrayed the depth of Gods love for us all.Mel Gibson does a great job in relaying the point that Jesus went willingly to the cross for us all; he did it for love, to reconcile lost humanity with God.Anti-Semitic claims are unfounded in a number of ways. First Jesus was born as a Jew, coming to save Jews. Secondly, they (Jews nor Romans) had no power to put Jesus on the cross; he willingly laid his life down for us all. And thirdly, we all put Jesus there. He died for the sins of the world. The same course of events would have happened if he had come to any other people group. As for \\"the blood being on the Jews heads and that of their children.\\" I say that is a blessing not a curse. It was by Jesus shed blood that humanity was reconciled to God. God is such a wonderful, loving redeemer that he can turn blood, a sign of death, into a sign of life.The graphicness of this film was tactful because it was realistic. I am glad that it was not watered down because this world is a violent place and Jesus faced the violence of the sinful nature of us all.

I saw The Passion Of The Christ at the movies ( sold out of course ) and left the theater very moved by this film. Mel Gibson really delivers in this film. My hat\'s off to him for having the courage to make such a film. I own the movie Jesus (2000) staring Jeremy Sisto and think this is a fabulous movie and Jeremy Sisto was the perfect choice to portray Jesus. He gave an outstanding performance! I also own Jesus of Nazereth which is a excellent film staring Robert Powell portraying Jesus. However, Passion starts with the final 12 hours of Jesus\' life. The movie starts with him praying in the garden and being tempted by Satan ( who in this film was actually portrayed by a woman ). We see Jesus stomp on the serpent that Satan has let loose..showing Satan that he will not be tempted and will continue to carry on the whole reason he was put on this earth. James Caviezel who portrays Jesus in this film delivers an outstanding performance. Even though the movie is not spoken out in the English language and you have to actually read everything that is said on the screen, it does not take away anything from this movie. Gibson wanted Jesus to speak in his native tongue of Arabic making this film more special to me. I must say that it is hard to watch all the beatings and torture that Jesus had to endure before his crucifixion. This movie really touches you.... especially the scenes between Jesus and his mother Mary. We can see the love Jesus has for his mother in the scenes when he is carrying the cross to the crucifixion site. Every time he sees his mother, it seems to give him more strength to carry on and carry on his purpose. The crucifixion itself is hard to watch for it makes you really realize the suffering Jesus went through for our sins to be forgiven.

It is a sturdy, beautifully-filmed version of a story that is eminently familiar to millions; the new spin here is the level of verisimilitude offered in depicting the last brutal hours leading to Christ\'s crucifixion.  And that\'s where the film is both brilliant and maddening.On the one hand, if its central message is that Jesus of Nazareth--whether one believes him to have been the son of God or simply a charismatic, visionary upstart--suffered a gruesome demise on behalf of his efforts, then showing suffering is absolutely critical to creating the proper catharsis about his sacrifice.  To that end, I found myself in tears several times, as well as filled with moments of joy and hope before the film ended, something that at my age doesn\'t happen from watching movies much anymore.On the other hand, I also wondered if everything I saw was truly necessary.  Too many films today have a pornographic fixation on violence, and the slow-motion shots and efforts to simultaneously mollify and shock with visceral images often tread into fetishism.  I found myself actually wondering while witnessing these moments if \\"Bambi\\" or \\"Old Yeller\\" were remade today, would we have 20-minute scenes of the demise of sympathetic characters not to illicit true emotions, but simply to appeal to some bloodthirsty part of ourselves that wants to see them.  (No, for those looking for an ax to grind, I\'m not comparing the life of Christ to children\'s movies; I\'m comparing the cinematic experience of creating deeply sympathetic characters that die to the notion of just how brutal their deaths must be to make us feel something profound.)If there are obvious weaknesses to the film, they are mostly technical.  Mel Gibson\'s direction is quite controlled and inspired, but like most contemporary filmmakers, he over-relies on the closeup, giving the film, as a friend later suggested, a claustrophobic feel.  John Debney\'s soundtrack is moving, even if some elements remind me of James Horner\'s \\"Glory\\" soundtrack.  Most of the cast is good, if thug-like or wan, and Jim Caveziel\'s Jesus, like Willem DaFoe\'s in \\"The Last Temptation of Christ,\\" is sympathetic but lacks the full virtue, kindness and profundity I associate with Christ.  In a word, he\'s just too ordinary (even if he\'s made up to look a little more like a product of the Middle East rather than Western Europe).Lastly, I\'ve never understood how anyone can profess to love Jesus but still somehow have animus toward Jews--it just boggles the mind.  I don\'t believe \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" reinforces negative stereotypes, though there clearly are villains and tormentors represented here, and I\'m sure some people will read into the characterizations what they will.  I found things pretty even-handed, with both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters of the faiths and ethnicities that share the spotlight in this film.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost a Truly Great Film", "unixReviewTime": 1113782400, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2005"}\n',

That a Hollywood actor would invest his own money and risk his career to tell this particular story--knowing the wrath that would follow--is truly worthy of all the praise the media is refusing to give him.  He\'s been attacked by everyone from the New York Times to Howard Stern.  Hollywood was also critical--until the box office numbers came out (the sudden praises of tinsel town types proves that $$$ is the god of Hollywood).As far as the charges of anti-Semitism go, I\'m always bewildered by anyone claiming to be a \\"Christian\\" who hates Jews.

Many left the theater visibly shaken, others in tears. I have not seen any other film have quite the effect on an audience that this one did. My wife and I did not speak a word until we were in the car for at least five minutes.I have seen many of the other \\"Passion\\" stories, everything from Franco Zeffirelli\'s \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" to Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" and while all of these have their individual merits, Gibson\'s Passion succeeds where the others don\'t always get it right. As viscerally wrenching as the film is, Gibson succeeds in capturing the key element that the others overlook: power.Gibson\'s \\"Passion Play\\" could just as easily be called the \\"Power Play,\\" because when you reduce the story to its key thematic elements, the crucifixion and death of Christ are about the complex power structure that Jesus threatened. Jesus, the son of a carpenter, threatened the religious power of the Pharisees over the Jewish people. He threatened the power of Pilate to keep the Jewish population in line. Herod, when Jesus is brought before him, however, is short-sighted enough to believe that, because Jesus does not perform a miracle on demand for him, Jesus has no power over him. Herod, of course, further ridicules Jesus and sends him back to Pilate.The thematic element of power undergirds all others in the film, and could be summed up in one of the lines of dialogue (roughly approximated here) that is taken from the gospel of John. Before he is sentenced to crucifixion, Jesus says to Pilate: \\"You have no power over me except what is given from above.\\" Therein lies the reminder that, although the earthly powers that be have beaten Jesus to a bloody pulp, mocked him, tormented him, and killed him in perhaps the most painful way possible, they truly have no power over him.As for the pre-release charges of anti-semitism, I am unconvinced that the film is anti-semitic. If this film is anti-semitic, then so is the entire New Testament. Although Caiaphas and some of the high priests are ultimately depicted as forcing Pilate\'s hand in crucifying Christ, there are notable dissenting voices among the high priests who feel that the charges against Christ are ridiculous. These high priests are quickly silenced and shoved out of the way by the high priest. I found the depictions of the Pharisees to be less favorable in Lloyd Webber\'s musical than in this film, and with the passage of time, the controversies over \\"Superstar\\" have died down considerably. I expect that the same will occur with this film.More disturbing than the singular hatred Caiaphas and other members of the Pharisees display toward Jesus is the merry brutality of the Romans, the group that comes off most poorly in the film. The centurions who carry out the graphic and bloody scourging of Christ are not just following orders--they visibly enjoy the torment they are inflicting. They believe they hold the ultimate power over Christ\'s physical body, and beat and ridicule him mercilessly, baring their awful teeth in sneers of derision from the courtyard where Christ is scourged all the way to Golgotha. If anyone is to be reviled, it is the Roman centurions.Another theme that Gibson captures so well in the film is the battle raging between the larger powers of good and evil. A pale, androgynous creature that we can only assume to be Satan appears throughout the film, reminding us that although this drama is the passion of the Christian God incarnate in a man, there is much more at stake than the petty power play on earth--the forces of good and evil have thrown down the gauntlet in Jerusalem.Gibson also acknowledges the fact that the crucifixion isn\'t the end of the story of Christ. Where Lloyd Webber\'s musical stops at the cross, Gibson\'s continues, albeit briefly, to the resurrection. Not that anyone can really give \\"spoilers\\" to one of the best-known plot lines of all time, but without giving too much away, let me just say that Gibson recognizes that the ultimate power play happens after the death of Jesus. Although he gives it somewhat short shrift in the closing moments of the film, we get a hint of the joy that is the Christian Easter holiday after getting hit with two hours of the brutal pain that is Good Friday in the Christian tradition.An ecumenical masterpiece, Gibson\'s work will be remembered by Christians long after the petty controversies have died down as a graphic reminder of Christ\'s suffering, death, and resurrection for the sins of the world. While the movie is certainly too intense for anyone younger than teenagers, it is a brutally accurate and moving experience for adults of any faith. The acting is magnificent, and the cinematography and score will move even the hardest of hearts.

The Passion follows the last hours of Jesus\' life from him being arrested to his trial all the way through his punishment and crucifixion.  Director Mel Gibson wanted to make a movie that realistically showed what Jesus went through in his final hours, and he definitely accomplished what he set out to do.  Passion is pretty accurate in telling the story of Jesus\' crucifixion although not much background is given to the story.  Much of the controversy was caused by cries of anti-Semitism, which I disagree with, and the extreme levels of violence.  This is a very graphic movie from beginning to end.  What sets it apart from most movie violence is that it is all realistic.  The movie follows the Roman soldiers scourging Jesus as well as a horrific crucifixion scene.  All of these scenes are hard to watch, and I think that is what Gibson wanted to do when he made this movie.  His goal was to show what horrible things Jesus Christ went through in his last hours, and I don\'t think he could have made it any more believable.Judging the movie as a film is much easier than examining the controversy behind it.  This is a beautifully shot movie with incredible cinematography from Caleb Deschanel.  Passion brings you into ancient Jerusalem at the time of Jesus\' life.  Equally as good is the score by composer John Debney.  Debney turns in an excellent middle eastern/arabic theme soundtrack that is perfect for the movie.  It is very moving, but it does not overpower the rest of the movie.James Caviezel is incredible as Jesus.  Unlike previous actors who have played Jesus, Caviezel actually looks somewhat like what Jesus would have looked like, or at least more so than Max van Sydow.  The whole movie is spoken in ancient Aramaic and Latin with Caviezel leading the way.  He gives an incredible performance.  Monica Belluci and Maia Morgenstern are excellent as Mary Magdalen and Mary, the mother of Jesus.

The DVD offers a beautiful looking widescreen presentation, but no other extras.

Jesus calls on the Father to forgive the sins of those present.  He is shown fighting Satan, more than he is the Sanhedrin.  Christians Scripture declare that we (and Jesus) battle spirits and principalities, not flesh and blood.  Gibson cleverly included this aspect, by introducing demons and the Devil into the plot. 2.

However, the film\'s merit lies not in there; Mel Gibson-directed film shows unexpectedly dramatic aspect of the historical and religious events of 2000 years ago, stressing the humanity of Christ and the people surrounding him.The plot is one of the most famous ones, so I don\'t repeat it.  The incidents are familiar ones -- from the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane to the crucification -- and Mel Gobson follows these events with the tactful editing and very effective flashbacks that depict equally famous moments in Christ\'s life -- Madgalene or the Last Supper.  Jim Caviezel literally becomes the image (our most shared image) of the Christ while Monica Bellucici plays Magdalene.  But the most impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, whose pain of watching her only son being killed is more painful to see than the bloody tortune scenes of the film.You already heard the talk about the blood the film shows.  Even though Mel avoids too direct descriptions, it is true that the scenes of the torture and the crucification by the Romans are very graphic.  You can smell the blood, and if you\'re a kind of a person who haven\'t seen the recent horror films, prepare for the shock.I said horror, and the allusion should be justified when some scenes really look like that.  The Satan played by Rosalinda Celentano (oh, and \\"her voice\\" is provided by a male actor) is incredibly spooky, while the last of Judas is, well, as you know, not a happy one to see.But the greatest merit of watching \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is, to me, that we can re-experience the incidents which we though we knew.  Actually, the story is a multi-layered one  involving such people as Mother Mary and Pilate, whom the film does not forget to describe.  One of the most touching moments comes with the flashback scenes when the film shows how Christ and his mother talk to each other about one small thing -- a table he made \\"which will never catch on.\\"  To see Mary cares her son as our own mothers do is so full of heart-breaking truth.Yes, the film is too cruel, and the blood could be overshadowing the spiritual aspects of the Christ.  And some say, quite understandably, this could be anti-Semitic though the film is clearly trying to avoid it.  Frankly, I don\'t know.

About a year ago, I learned of Mel Gibson\'s THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and knew then that Mel was basically making the movie I had always wanted to see made.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is exactly that, it is a fairly in-depth look at Jesus\'s last 12 hours on Earth before His death and all the pain and suffering He went through to save all of humankind.

The suffering is so great that He is sweating blood.  In this scene at Gethsemane, Satan is there, whispering from a tree, probably much like he did in Eden.  He tries to convince Jesus that one man cannot possibly bear all the sins of the world.  The scene ends with Jesus stomping on the head of a serpent and the entrance of Judas and the temple troops into the garden.  I mention this scene because it is really the only part in the movie that the spiritual burden of the passion is illustrated: Jesus isn\'t just preparing to go through extreme physical torture, He is also preparing to take upon Himself all the sins of the world.  This spiritual element is just as important as the physical.The rest of the film follows the story found in the Gospels. Jesus is brought before the Jewish council, then before Pilot, then to Herod, then back to Pilot. He is beaten, then finally sentenced to be crucified.  We follow Him through the streets of Jerusalem to Golgotha where He is nailed upon the cross and dies.  But the story doesn\'t end there.  The sky turns black, the temple is torn in two, and the ground rumbles with a massive earthquake, and the film ends with a brief scene from the resurrection.The acting in the film is superb.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to have so many people speaking languages which until fifteen years ago were considered dead. The cinematography is splendid. The musical score full of vigor and life.  Gibson\'s direction is practically flawless and now he is probably a better director than he is an actor.As for some of the criticism against the film.  The film is not anti-sematic.  The movie makes a point out of showing how brutal the Romans were in dishing out punishment and death.  Other than a minor beating by the temple guards, the Jewish leaders had very little to do with the actual torture of Jesus.The film is also violent, but that\'s really the point. Christ endured so much to save us. We often forget that.  However, even though the movie is violent, there have been many other films that I think were much more so.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is probably just as violent as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, but both films are moving and have strong messages.  Any Quentin Tarantino film ever made is far more violent than THE PASSION. One difference is that in THE PASSION, the violence is all directed towards one man, whereas in most other movies, the violence tends to be spread out amongst several people. ...Overall, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a very moving film, full of vivid images, great acting, sound direction, and a powerful score.  If you view the film with an open mind and heart, it could change your life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\\"Greater Love Hath No Man Than This\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1077667200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2004"}\n',

He also artfully and beautifully illustrates the dichotomy of good and evil, and a humanity that is faced to side either of the extremes. Visually stunning with awe-inspiring cinematography, it is more than telling with every scene what Gibson implies: praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is weak, afraid, and taunted. Having Satan appear in this scene reminisces of the temptation of Christ, with Satan\'s presence meant to discourage him, and Satan\'s words telling Christ the burden is to heavy for a man to carry. (In Luke, it is mentioned that Jesus is so distraught during this time that an angel from heaven appears to console him, but it appears that starting with this first scene, Gibson\'s film would be a combination of the Gospels, not obedient to one Gospel, but to all of them.)Gibson is very articulate with every second that goes by. The characters are so conflicted and confused during such a catastrophic event that their sufferings are intense in their moments of remorse (i.e., Judas, Peter, Pilate). Gibson&#65533;s imagination supplements well with what Scripture has to offer, as at some points the Gospels are rather lacking in detail. I also especially enjoyed the Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. It indeed added to the realism of the story, something that is immensely lacking in any other Jesus film.Before viewing this film, I would say it would be wise to review the Gospels. It is only those who are familiar with Scripture who will come to realize how beautifully Gibson brings Christ&#65533;s story to life, and how he succeeds in doing so without any assumption (especially with the characters &#65533; Pontius Pilate being a sympathetic, conflicted character is NOT a myth, it is Biblical; the high priests being inhumane and blood thirsty, also Biblical).The aftermath of the release of such a film will be interesting. I will not be surprised if a comparison between this and The Exorcist will be brought to light, which should be a delight. Both films are directed by men of great faith, whose intentions include expressing their love for religion, the intensity of what is inside their hearts, and also to shock, frighten, and inspire people back into their faith.I will enjoy The Passion of the Christ again and again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "breathtaking and accurate....much respect to Gibson.", "unixReviewTime": 1078704000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2004"}\n',

Marshall", "helpful": [9, 12], "reviewText": "This movie had a deeply profound affect on me, not my religious beliefs, not my historical knowledge, but on ME as a person. Despite all the rhetoric involved in the release, the promotion and the hype it clearly sends a message to humanity.....to suffer for your fellow man is the ultimate sacrifice but it will lead to the greatest of honor.This extraordinary film is the re-enactment of the passion as explained in the four books of the Gospel. It helps to read these books prior to the film if you are not familiar with the story or if you want to be able to compare and contrast Gibson\'s idea to the truth as told within the Bible. Most of the film is very dark but brings to light historical figures that lived in a time of horrible brutality. If crimes were punished in a similar way today I doubt we would have many criminals! Christ knows his direction in life and has willingly accepted his own death in order to save the sins of humanity. Whether or not you believe the religious theory behind this sacrifice the story represents what all humans should be willing to do for the life of another. This movie is absolutely brutal and so graphic that the faint at heart will have to turn away, but don\'t, the least we can do for this historical figure is watch a movie that depicts His suffering. As for the anti-Semitism that was so widely touted I didn\'t see it. To be honest with you I felt angrier at the Romans for the relentless beating they gave to Christ. But it isn\'t a class, gender or race issue that is involved in this story it is about humanity as a whole and how we resort to violence instead of acceptance towards the things we don\'t understand. All creeds, religions and sects have authorized brutal killings for the sake of their faith so no one is more able to wipe their hands of Christ\'s death than any other.James Caviezel plays the part of Jesus Christ with such perfection you will feel as though you have been transported back in time and are actually meeting the image of the man Himself. This role required a great deal from Caviezel, demanding endurance and exhibiting compassion without going overboard as so many other actors have done in the past. The film is spoken in Aramaic and Latin (with sub-titles) and Caviezel is flawless in his accent bringing even more depth to his portrayal. By the end of this movie the only thing that can move on Caviezel is his eyes and in those last subtle shifts of movement his acting becomes something phenomenal. Beside Caviezel in her role as Mary Magdalene is Monica Bellucci whose loyalty and soft determination follows Christ to His grave along with Mother Mary (played by Maia Morgenstern). The women are the strength of this film just as I imagine them to have been in real life although they were ostracized by the men who wrote the Bible. Rosalinda Celentano is the ever present Satan that horrible evil that lurks in every nook and cranny of this film and she is downright scary. Caiphas is presented as a vindictive man and is played nicely by Mattia Sbragia. Close to Caviezel in excellence is Hristo Shopov cast as the powerful but weak Pontius Pilate. The truly amazing thing is that none of the actors in this film are really \\"stars\\" but they all succeed in their roles with a grace and spirit that stands above the fluff and muster of Hollywood.Mel Gibson has done something here that surpasses bravery, he has taken a highly controversial subject (religion and faith), stayed very close to the story as told in the Gospels and dared to put his own funding up to support it, so is he crazy or was he driven to bring a taste of faith back into a hollow humanity. Not only is this film beautiful to watch but it is as accurate a story as can be told based upon historical and religious records. The music is haunting and magical. The use of foreign language a feat in its own right for American audiences who would rather eat popcorn than read subtitles. But Gibson\'s real gift is how he manages to inspire something in people who see this film, it may be tears, compassion, renewed faith, anger, spite or indifference but at least it stirs up something in a massive audience of people who all too often don\'t have to feel anything while watching a film. If you don\'t walk away from this film feeling changed inside and willing to see Christ as a human being who loved more than himself then the sadness rests with you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Passionate", "unixReviewTime": 1094169600, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2004"}\n',

On the contrary, it was the Jewish LEADERS that killed Christ, as it was the German LEADERS that killed the Jews - and both out of envy. If Christ had been born in Ireland or some other country, it would have been their leaders that killed Him. WHO killed Christ is unimportant.What is important is WHY Christ died. He wasn\'t murdered - He gave up His own life willingly as part of God\'s plan for saving His people from their sins. If you watch The Passion and all you see is brutality, blood and death, you\'re missing the point. The point is, without Christ\'s sacrifice, we would all die in our sins and spend the rest of eternity separated from God, because none of us is good enough to save himself. But God, out of love, took on Himself our sins in the person of Christ. We were the ones scheduled to be brutally beaten and die on that cross; but God, out of love, took the punishment for us and died in our place. He did what we couldn\'t do for ourselves. And then He did one more thing: He raised Himself from the dead, proving for all time that He indeed was God; and showing that, one day, we, too, would rise again.The Passion Of The Christ shows the sacrifice that Christ made for us, which only love could have compelled Him to do. The brutality only underscores His love. If you don\'t watch The Passion and see the love behind it, you\'re missing the point; and, possibly, missing the boat as far as what Christ came to bring.Christ was born to die. He wasn\'t born to teach, heal or show the way: He IS the Way. He was born to die - not pointlessly, but purposefully, so that we could live. THAT\'s what The Passion is all about: not brutality, blood and death; but love, sacrifice and life.

Mel Gibson\'s vision could be viewed as extreme and in some cases unwatchable. The debate(s) in the film are endless as Christianity stresses that Jesus Christ \\"suffered\\" for our sins. However, was his suffering this extreme?  Only the people who who were present could only know. Yet, if one studied the brutality of the Romans as they put on feats of carnage at the Coliseum, one could argue that the same brutality was shed at crucifixions (pre and during).  The other debate is the question of anti-semitism.  No! this film does not promote anti-semitism.  However, it was the Jewish Rabbis and clergymen who forced the Romans and egged-on their \'people\' to have Jesus Christ killed because they felt threatened. Lastly, the success of the film is probably due to the timing of its release.  Every once in a while, a reaffirmation of faith is needed by the population and perhaps a serious religious film such as \'THE PASSION...\' was needed.  There hasn\'t been a major release of this type of film in a while and with a slew of recent films concerning the supernatural, demonic, and witchcraft etc. Mel Gibson grabbed his opportunity and the film took on a life of its own. Because of this film, it is now reported that the Bible is being looked at as a new source of ideas for films (Are there Bible related or religious comic books out there?).

The astoundingly popular new movie in theatres nationwide at the time of this writing, \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" as directed by Mel Gibson, had sold out in my Midwest town on the first weekend of its showing. While admittedly feeling just a little anxious about seeing onscreen the brutality of a realistic crucifixion-I had heard so much about this aspect of it, and I otherwise avoid movies promoted as violent-I was increasingly eager to see with my own eyes, judge with my own mind, what I was hearing discussed so heatedly everywhere I turned. With record breaking sales, the movie was bringing in unprecedented crowds.I had read and viewed countless interviews and reviews and op-eds about Gibson\'s portrayal of Christ\'s crucifixion, heard the talk around the water cooler at the office, shared the insights over dinner with friends, debated the message sent to viewers over a cold one at the pub.And then: the theatre lights dim.The opening scene is blue with moonlight. The shadow of a man in a garden, silhouettes of trees surrounding him, the soft breathing of sleepers nearby. We hear the whisper of anguished prayer, the kind we pray when our hearts are raw with terror and loneliness. Christ prays, alone, to his Father, while his disciples sleep, and for a moment he is more son of man than Son of God, for he feels as we feel, and the sweat runs down his face, lit by the moon, as he trembles with premonition. A silent figure with haunting eyes glimpses between the silhouetted trees, watching, listening. Satan is played by a female figure, male voice dubbed over, androgynous and as oddly seductive in its manner as any evil. This silent figure is always near.It is some time into the movie before I feel the first hot flush of tears wash over my eyes. Perhaps I have been prepared by all the talk. Perhaps I know the story well enough. There are no surprises. If my breathing strains at the merciless scourging, I do not, will not, look away. How can I? It is my hand that holds the whip. It is I who have dealt the punishment. It is I who nevertheless receive the reward of mercy and forgiveness. And so I bear witness.The moment that breaks me down and pushes me over is one that taps into my mother\'s heart. I watch as Mary\'s face pales with pain. I watch as she struggles through the crowd massed around to see her son carry His cross, even as the soldiers continue to beat Him. She can do nothing, nothing to stop them, nothing to stop what must be, what her son Himself has accepted fully as the cup that is His to drink. She can, however, let Him see her among that crazed and maddened crowd, let His eyes meet hers for an instant, offering the support of her mother\'s heart through eyes alone. When her son falls to His knees beneath the terrible weight He carries, Mary recalls instantly the little boy fallen in the dust of the road that runs along their house and how she rushes to Him, embracing him, soothing away His pain. This time, she can\'t save Him, nor even hold Him, but her eyes send her love to Him across the crowd, and He is strengthened by it.As witness of this scene, one that resonates in me so deeply that I grow dizzy with the pain of empathy and understanding, I allow my own tears to flow freely. I am broken and healed simultaneously.We all know how the story ends. Or, at least, where it ends when the last page of the Book is turned. Beyond that it is continued individually in our own lives and through our own daily choices and decisions, as lifelong witnesses to the sacrifice made for each and every one of us.Having held back from all the vapid discussions around water coolers and in neighborhood pubs previously, I\'m glad now I can offer my own perspective. And that is: Gibson has courageously created a masterpiece. I would change nothing. I know the story so well, as many of us do, yet seeing it on screen so vividly left a powerful effect that haunts me still, days after seeing it, and perhaps lifelong. The entire movie is an invitation to explore one\'s heart, one\'s conscience, one\'s spirituality, one\'s life. It is a movie that changes lives.And is the violence gratuitous? I have heard so much about this-the violence of Christ\'s crucifixion. And I am offended by the accusation. How can our society be so hypocritical? In a time when we allow pornography on every venue, referring to this abuse of human rights and dignity as \\"freedom of expression\\", when we allow our children to play video games that glamorize murder, when every other movie on the screen today makes a sport of killing and torment, when child abuse has become rampant, and war rages across the planet.... we dare call a movie that realistically portrays the suffering one man, Son of God, endures for each and every one of us ... too violent? How dare we. I suspect it is our shame of the hammer and nail we each hold in our own hands that allows such rationalization.I highly recommend this movie.

The film chronicles key events and influences in his rise from humble origins to professional excellence as one of the world\'s best surgeons.Carson\'s life was marked by serious adversity and disadvantage.  He overcame these obstacles in the same time-tested manner that all people discover who aim for virtue and accomplishment--the loving encouragement and direction of others, in Carson\'s case his mother and wife, good choices, hard work, self-denial, and, most important, a reliance upon God.The film depicts a pivotal period in Carson\'s life during which his explosive and violent temper nearly destroys him.  Recognizing his own inability to tame and master his destructive impulses, Carson admits his need for divine help and healing.  He remains a committed Christian to this day.While a normal length film like \\"Gifted Hands\\" cannot do justice to the richness and detail of Ben Carson\'s life, leaving the interested viewer with many unanswered questions, the film does provide insight into the inspiration for Carson\'s remarkable medical successes and his exemplary character.  His life also reminds us that as far as we may get through our own efforts and the support of others (and these are very important factors of course), we need the help, guidance, and wisdom of God even more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Truly inspirational", "unixReviewTime": 1337299200, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2012"}\n',

I think I even saw some reviews here for the book.  Just for the record, both the Feature Length Film AND the Documentary of the same name are excellent and both deserve 5 stars.  The documentary stars the real Dr. Ben Carson as himself, while the Movie stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dr. Ben Carson.  Apparently, a number of people have ordered the documentary thinking it was the movie, and others have ordered the movie expecting the documentary.  I am suspect that the trouble with these two products is even messing with the ordering process causing people to receive an item they didn\'t order.  This confusion has resulted in a lot of people receiving the wrong product and are therefore dissatisfied - leaving unwarranted bad reviews.  I really hope Amazon gets this mistake straightened out because there are a lot of people upset about this and they don\'t know what is happening.That being said, the FEATURE LENGTH FILM is an inspiring story that is well acted, moving and as far as I can tell, reasonably faithful to the truth.  This is saying a lot because movie makers and screenplay writers are notorious for changing  the facts to make a story more &#34;interesting&#34; . With a few minor exceptions, the spirit of Ben Carson\'s personal account of his life is pretty much what really happened.  I am glad to find the real story more or less intact here.I would highly recommend this movie, AND THE DOCUMENTARY to anyone who likes a good TRUE story.  I completely enjoyed watching this.

Just as I could not live on a steady diet of filet mignon or Beef Wellington, I wouldn\'t care to focus exclusively on great literature and art films. Besides, productions should be judged within their own genre and on their own merits.That said, My Cousin Rachel is a delight. Olivia de Havilland is gorgeous as the eponymous cousin, who may be a fortune hunter, a murderess, a charmingly worldly woman or perhaps a combination of any and all those things. Burton is young, passionate, obsessed, violent, generous, remorseful, suspicious and jealous-- the sort of man one would run from in real life, though by his skill, he makes his character sympathetic.Rachel falls short of being in the same category as Rebecca, simply because Rebecca was directed by the great master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock , who could make a cliff, some ocean spume (and judicious use of music ) appear portentous.I enjoyed every minute of this production.  If you agree, and haven\'t yet seen the following, I would recommend: The Heiress, with de Havilland and Montgomery Clift - based on Henry James\' Washington Square; and Hitchock\'s Parradine Case, with Alida Valli ( one of the best femmes fatales ever ), Gregory Peck and Louis Jordan.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you loved Rebecca", "unixReviewTime": 1390089600, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2014"}\n',

Not only is the atmosphere completely realized, but the elegant performances make the story even more compelling to watch as it unfolds a tale of possible murder and cunning deceit. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards for best costumes, B&W; cinematography, art decoration and Burton\'s supporting role performance (which is actually a leading role).RICHARD BURTON cuts a fine figure as the romantic hero of the piece--brooding, intense and passionate, reminding one of Heathcliff in the Bronte novel, \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" He\'s an angry and impressionable youth who intends to accuse his cousin of murder based on his suspicious nature, but instead falls wildly in love with her the instant they meet.OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND matches Burton scene by scene, her charming manners and poise as a woman of the world understandably provoking his interest. At first, he assumes she wants to claim her inheritance when she visits Cornwall. But soon he is able to see her in a different light and when he falls in love with her, he decides to leave his entire inheritance to her on his 25th birthday. It is then that the story becomes even more compelling when the ambiguous nature of Rachel comes at long last to the surface.Franz Waxman has written a very dramatic and powerful background score that adds dimension to the Gothic tale that begins when a boy and his guardian walk across the moors and come to a gibbet where a man is hanging. \\"Always remember, Philip, death is the price for murder.\\" And that\'s how the film\'s brief prologue begins.It\'s richly scored, well directed by Henry Koster and features two outstanding performances from Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton. Equally fine are John Sutton as Rachel\'s ill-fated husband, Audrey Dalton, Ronald Squire and George Dolenz.Despite the ambiguous ending, it\'s an absorbing tale that is satisfying in its execution.

It supports the thesis that, not only was Nazism the heir to Communism, but that its leaders, Hitler, and Lenin, and Stalin,  substantially cooperated with one another and learned from one another. Nazism was only different from Communism is that it was ethnically and racially based...whereas Communism was economically and class based. Philosophically, as Goebbels publicly wrote, they were the same, in their employment of repression, and mass murder, and fear to achieve their \\"idealistic\\" aims.The romantic leanings of too many in the West, then as now, always seem to pit early Communism against Nazism....one being good and idealistic, and the other being pure evil. This DVD demonstrates like no other film, that nothing could be further from the truth...for Nazism and Communism, aside from occasional distrust, from the beginning, were bound together with bonds of friendship, affection, and cooperation. That alliance ceased when Hitler broke his written pact with Stalin in their common plans for dividing a post war Europe....as had ALREADY been achieved with their joint invasion of Poland. It\'s often portrayed that it was Hitler who began WW II. True, as far as it goes...But the full truth is that, in fact, it was both Hitler and Stalin who planned and executed the 1939 attack on Poland.In addition, this DVD is an excellent antidote in smashing the illusions of all too many North American liberals, and Euro and South American leftists...who still believe that somehow...it was only Stalin who abandoned the \\"ideals\\" of Communism....to become one of the two bloodiest murders of the 20th century. These illusions still exist today, in the all too gentle reminder, that Lenin was somehow the \\"good\\" communist. In fact, this DVD documents Lenin\'s class warfare and mass murder of ten million, as the ideological \\"solution\\" paving the way for his \\"ideal\\" communist state...and the \\"New Soviet Man\\". This Hitler directly copied with the \\"New German Man\\". Nazism also emulated the concentration camps, which were FIRST established in Lenin\'s regime....BEFORE Stalin....and served as the Nazi template for the Holocaust....20 years before it occurred.\\"The Soviet Story\\" is a powerful documentary...for it speaks the truth with first person interviews, and weaves a quite convincing review of the Soviet era historic documentation...key parts of which, were smuggled out of today\'s \\"new\\" Russian state apparatus. In fact, it\'s well to remember Putin\'s absurd statements about the \\"fall of the USSR\\" being one of the \\"great tragedies\\" of the twentieth century. This is why this DVD remains timely...as the new Russia still retains significant elements of the old USSR. It remains timely, because the same coterie of delusional western intellectuals still remain fuzzy about the harsh reality of Russian history. As the reviewer for \\"The Economist\\" wrote, this film is a powerful antidote to the \\"sanitization of the past\\".For Americans, history will show a period of hesitation about the post war intentions of Stalin. But by 1948, those intentions were abundantly clear to all but the most willful deniers. The key roles of George Kennan, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower defined our initial responses to the USSR. Containment in it\'s peaceful impulse, and in its defensive impulse, in NATO and MAD, BOTH played their role in the evolution of the leadership of the USSR. The world did avoid a nuclear holocaust. And, as an addendum on the ending of the Cold War, it\'s well to note that it was the \\"big tent\\" Republican, Ronald Reagan, who opposed his own right wing, to negotiate with Micheal Gorbachev. Both, along with Lech Walesa and the Pope, with the big exception of the old Yugoslavia, paved the way to the relatively bloodless denouement to the Cold War.I can therefore also highly recommend:The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan: A History of the End of the Cold War, by Jim Mann.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Harsh Reality", "unixReviewTime": 1257811200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2009"}\n',

As Don Carroll explains in the featurette following the documentary, he and his wife, Noriko, were at an advantage of being able to capture such intimate and unimpeded footage of the hummingbirds because of the location of the nest - a clothesline out in the open, rather than in a tree which would have been much more difficult to film due to thickness of branches and leaves, winds and the difficulties in placing cameras in advantageous positions.In this film we actually view the movement inside the eggs of the future hatchlings, watch them puncture the first hole in the eggs, rest and then continue their pursuit to break through to their new lives.  What is particularly moving is the attentiveness of their mother, Honey, as she watches over, nurtures and protects her two offspring, especially from the Carroll\'s family cat.Speaking of this cat, it\'s not just any cat.  No, it is Birthday, stepping right out of the pages of another book of the Carrolls, \\"Happy Birthday the Cat,\\" which has some terrific photographs of this pretty feline.

It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn\'t?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena\'s laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma\'s roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It\'s Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that\'s how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can\'t help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star\'s 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You\'re  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you\'d expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It\'s  good, get it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just like St. Joan", "unixReviewTime": 965865600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2000"}\n',

Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances. There are spurts of humor, improvised lyrics, and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience. This isn\'t a particularly important concert; it isn\'t his first nor his last. However, it\'s being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be. One word describes it: amazing. The extra features are just as good. There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous. It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience\'s reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, \\"I love you too.\\" This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get, the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley, he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Enthralling", "unixReviewTime": 1105401600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2005"}\n',

This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \\"Don Giovanni.\\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore\'s funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master\'s 2,065 conquests in \'Madamina.\'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan\'s favorite singers.  You\'ll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa\'s soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart\'s music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni\'s servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master\'s discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He\'s such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it\'s as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey\'s movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I\'ve seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey\'s Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I\'ve heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady\'s performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle\'s lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan\'s tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi\'s Don is out on DVD, too, but I\'d buy this one first.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hoggamus Higgamus", "unixReviewTime": 1041897600, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2003"}\n',

I\'d suggest starting withExtreme Makeover Fitness - Weight Loss Workout for Beginners.**This is a kickboxing AEROBICS video.  It is meant to give you a workout that is based upon kickboxing.  It\'s not intended to teach you how to do professional kickboxing.  If you want a fun and challenging workout, kickboxing aerobics is a great choice.**I\'m in great shape because of kickboxing aerobics.  It\'s one of the few cardio exercises that really works the whole body at once.  It\'s also empowering and fun.Few kickboxing aerobic DVDs teach you proper form.  This one does.  Keith Cooke is a professional with multiple titles, who teaches real kickboxing classes.  He is given a side window on your screen throughout the workout.  He teaches you proper footing, form and how to execute the drills safely. Kathy Smith does the main aerobics instruction.  She offers a few alterations for beginners.  She also helps Cooke keep the instruction going at times when he gets too quiet.  As a team, these two give you all you need to get started and to practice drills that will help you keep proper form.WHO TO WATCH:BEGINNERS:Watch Kathy Smith.  (Watch Keith Cooke when he is given the side windows.  He is going to teach you how to execute the punches and kicks properly.)  Kathy Smith will show you easier alterations to some of the tougher moves.INTERMEDIATES:Watch Keith Cooke or the female behind him, to the left.  (She is introduced as Murmur, dressed in black and white.)  Keith and Murmur have almost identical form.  While the rest of the instructors tend to be a bit \\"dancy\\", these two are no- nonsense boxers.  They have a lot of energy and tons of power behind their kicks and punches.  Keeping up with Keith\'s speed will make you sweat, no matter how in shape you are.I don\'t suggest following the third main instructor (Kelly Roberts).  She tends to throw her body awkwardly off balance while kicking and punching.  She\'s very \\"showy\\" and doesn\'t really follow Keith\'s suggestions for form.HOW TO ADD MORE CHALLENGE:Use weighted gloves and ankle weights.  I useAltus Athletic AWK-PK Pink Walk Kit.  While I hate pink, this set of gloves and ankle weights is mostly black with pink trim.  However, the price ($19.99 for the set of gloves and ankles all together) is right and quality is good.Do Keith\'s \\"Kickboxing Challenge\\".  If you do the whole 55 minute \\"kickboxing challenge workout\\", you\'ll have Keith\'s 5 minutes of challenging combos at the end.  If you want to do just his 5 minute challenge, you\'ll find it under the main menu in \\"choose your own workout\\".Double- time the kicks and punches when Kathy slows down to teach beginners the moves.  By the time this video loses it\'s challenge for you, you\'ll know the moves well enough to get right into doing them at tempo.Once you have the moves down, you might want to try some more kickboxing DVDs.

There aren\'t any demonstrations on these steps offering side views for us to follow. Even when the dance changes frequently, there isn\'t time to learn, you just go into these steps.

Kathy works out with two dance instructors, Clara and Ashley, in front of a class of about 10 additional participants.  The setting is on a dance floor in front of a band on a stage, although the camera occasionally shows the group in a smaller, carpeted room.  Prior to the start of the workout, Kathy provides a brief overview of the three main moves that will be used:  the salsa, the merengue, and the cha-cha.The video is actually broken into two separate workouts, although they flow together nicely for a longer session.  Workout 1 starts with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of simple steps to get you moving; you\'ll really shake your hips and begin to raise your heart rate from the start.  Next, you\'ll focus on each of the three dance moves in turn, spending approximately 5 minutes on each segment.  Because you are just learning the footwork, Kathy does not specifically teach any upper body moves, but I found that by involving my shoulders and hips in the movements, my heart rate was really getting up by the end of this workout, which lasted about 19 1/2 minutes total.  Workout 2 starts right up with a slow merengue segment that serves as a kind of warm-up.  Following this, the workout again focuses on each of the three dance moves in turn, starting with a fast merengue, moving to the salsa, and ending with the cha-cha.  This time, you\'ll add some more traditional exercises to the dance steps--eg, there are lunges, knee lifts, etc.  You\'ll also do slightly more complicated versions of the basic steps as well as add a bit more upper body into the movements.  The second workout is about 18 minutes long, and then Kathy leads you through a short series of stretches to cool-down, bringing the entire workout in at about 41 minutes.  As a bonus, the the video ends with a brief segment where Clara and Ashley display how to perform each of the three dance moves with a partner (this was the only part of the video that was true dance instruction).After doing both workouts in one longer session, I wasn\'t quite sweating, but I definitely felt like I got a good, low-impact cardio workout.  I\'m not a fan of complex choreography, but I found the dance moves to be simple to learn and fun to perform.  At times, I\'m sure I was moving in ways that didn\'t quite match what Kathy and the others were doing, but the great thing was that it didn\'t matter since I was moving, keeping my heart rate up, and having a good time.  I thought that Kathy cued well as always and that she did a nice job with the dance moves--she certain danced better than I did!  She provided mostly live instruction, but there were also occasional voiceovers in which she gave additional cueing and form pointers.

The DVD has the exercises, but the CD has them to fit voice ranges (tenor, baritone, and bass for men, soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto for women.)  New copies should have it automatically, so check with the seller if you get one used.So I watched the DVD and it is very comprehensive.  The first 15 or so minutes do feature a lot of musicians praising Ms. Cross and going on about why her techniques work.  One you pass that, then you start getting into exercises, first the physical exercises and then the musical ones.  Each follows the format of Ms. Cross demonstrating the exercise, then having a guest (either a student or a professional musician) demonstrate the exercise, and then commentary from pro musicians as to why the exercises are effective.Was there a lot of emphasis on actual screaming?  No, but you have to learn to crawl before you walk, and there\'s way, way, way too much information on this disc to discredit it for not featuring more on screaming.  I ordered the second disc so I\'ll let you all know if that contains more information on screaming (it was advertised that it should, so...)Otherwise, this is a must-have for any vocalist who\'s trying to be in ANY group where the music is amplified.  I\'ve received classical training before, but there\'s a lot on this disc that I wish I would have known before.

Like David says, around the 60\'s they started changing the way we learned history and moved away from the faith aspects of the Founders and moved toward the economic aspects. Most who want to change history talk about Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson about being non-religous and portray all founders that way. They might have been the least religous but in today\'s world they would be far more outspoken about faith and God than most preachers today.For anyone who wants to learn the truth about our history I would highly recommend this series.

I\'m not sure if other copies of MEDIC available on AMAZON.com  include missing episodes but I am buying them to find out. IF I find any missing episodes of MEDIC in these other offerings I\'ll update this review with that information if I can.I am happy I brought this MEDIC DVD for what would likely be considered all the wrong reasons. MEDIC is most known to be a military term on one who is versed in the medical arts in some form.  Usually battlefield medical personnel of some type are called Medic.  Yet the term MEDIC for which this series is named has no overt military connection. Despite the beautiful picture of LA County General Hospital being used as a backdrop on the cover, many hospital locales are used or suggested in this MEDIC series.MEDIC is a series where most of the wood is in the acting.  I have never seen so much totally wooden acting in my life.  The VOICE OF GOD, narration style also makes the entire MEDIC series feel like one of those government army propoganda films or worse one of those health films from the 1950\'s.  None of this is meant to say don\'t buy MEDIC because; watching this stuff is hilarious. Watching the episode where a man\'s heavy Sweedish accent comes and goes had me on the floor laughing so hard I cried tears.Huge issue with MEDIC is sound quality or the complete lack thereof.  There is an all too noticable darn near constant hiss during all the programs. The sound of the hiss is so annoying. The hiss sound in the background is not unlike having your own private water fall hidden somewhere in every scene.  The hiss can\'t easily be ignored but with practice you hear it less.  The stilted 1950\'s wholesome dialogue is very much in evidence here. MEDIC is so completely censored that you could easily think the positively reckless shiftless censors for Dr. Kildaire was Caligula himself.  In MEDIC ladies looked down in modesty when talking to men folk.  Ladies were sheepish or fawn like. Some of the men came off as total dweebs.  the video quality is a 4 on the one to five scale.  Some episodes being better or worse than others but the vodeo quality is pretty good overall.  No dark areas, artifacts, hair or fuzz on the screen, no projector noise the constant hiss background sound effectively blocks it all out. No over exposed too bright white out in the video.  The video is almost first rate which makes MEDIC watchable despite the constant hiss sound.All in all MEDIC is fun to watch in that Mystery Science Theatre 3000 sort of way. The bots would have a field day tearing new ones in these wooden actors with their sugary sickeningly sweet their pastey dialogue.  MEDIC reminds me of Reefer Madness in the portrayal of bad people who have abandoned wholesome virtue. If you put the Leave It To Beaver in a hospital setting you\'d have MEDIC which is why its so funny.I did not think I remembered seeing reruns of MEDIC growing up. I only remembered MEDIC after seeing its opening. So yes I did see MEDIC in reruns as a very young child. I remember the snake crawing up the staff in the opening because; seeing that frightened me. The whole snake crawling up the staff seemed aweful creepy and not in a good way.  In MEDIC so far the death toll of lost patients is not that high.  Patients die on the operating table sometimes but they are brought back. MEDIC exists before the idea of defibelation was in wide use.  When your heart stopped on the table they massaged your heart hoping it restarted.  No adrelilan no calcuim carbonate, no crash cart, none of the normal things you see in todays medical dramas when hearts stop beating.That said MEDIC surgeries look a whole lot more convincing and realistic. The doctors behaviors and use of that era\'s primative instruments in and out of surgery seems far more relaistic \\\\ natural and not rehersed at all. The most shocking thing about MEDIC is how primative the technology of the day looks even to lay people with no medical background whatsoever.  When the treatment for a blocked heart valve was to open the heart so the dictor could poke his finger in the valve to release its flaps I darn near died laughing. We all know today a bad valve would be replaced by a pig\'s valve or some weird plastic thing.Today after 50 plus years going to hospitals for my 13 disabilities MEDIC is fun to watch nothing I see there scares me now. MEDIC is an interesting case study in both our medical history and cultural evolution. MEDIC is worth its price on the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 cheezyness of the dialogue and wooden acting alone.  When MEDIC was written the treatments were state of the art.  When MEDIC was written the dry stiff people and painfully scripted dialogue was how all so called \\"good people\\" were expected to behave. MEDIC made me laugh so hard, I think if you don\'t buy this and you enjoyed Mystery Science Theatre 3000 you do yourself an almost criminal dis-service not buying this. Trust me watching MEDIC will wake up your inner wise-cracking systems and they will promptly run amuk. MEDIC is a target rich environment for people who liked Mystery Sicence Theatre 3000.  You want to have some real fun.  Put on a MEDIC DVD and get together a few of your most insane friends who see humor in everything.

It has all the ingredients one would expect for film of this nature: ultra-violence,sleaze,lack of and disregard for political correctness,raw,independent guerrilla film-making feel, evocative locations of an era long extinct etc.Fast-paced, despite some shoddy editing and a pointless romantic sub-plot with a detective and his GF(the film\'s only real flaws IMO). Big on action,just the opening sequence alone will have the viewer hooked. Some very creative kills, including a kill with a meat-grinder and when a prostitute gets tortured with a soldering-iron(mostly off-camera, but implied enough that you get the point and disturbing). Some great explosions despite the budgetary constraints. An authentic realism and feel to the story. Very un-P.C.(a big plus for some), back in the day when you could make a movie without social and political pressure to tow a certain ideological party line. And no preaching or \\"social redeeming\\" crap. Love it! Enough brutal violence and some excellent bloodshed to satisfy genre fans.In the past, most copies were the censored theatrical version. Now,the cuts only amount to about 40 seconds or so(mostly the decaptation at the opening Vietnam sequence and the meat-grinder kill), but it\'s still nice to have it uncut,just out of principle alone. When Anchor bay got it, they released it uncut for the first time, on VHS and DVD,not a great transfer.

He doesn\'t get top billing, but Robert Ginty is clearly the center of attention, in this tale of revenge, as a former soldier employs his fighting skills in a new arena.  Not the toughest or most charismatic guy around, Ginty might appear an unlikely choice for such a gritty tale, but he brings a certain sense of realism to the role, and is just a fun guy to watch in action.After having served together in Viet Nam, army buddies John Eastland (Ginty) and Michael Jefferson (Steve James), return to civilian life.  Working at a food warehouse in NYC, they have a fight with three men trying to steal beer.  The punks, who are members of a gang called the Ghetto Ghouls, later ambush Jefferson, and do permanent damage to his spine.Without any hesitation, Eastland is on a quest for retribution.  He tracks down the men, blasts one with an M-16, and leaves the other two to be ravaged by rats.  Looking to get some money for Jefferson\'s family, Eastland next targets a mob leader, who has extorted money from workers like Jefferson.  The sensational crimes, are investigated by a police detective named Dalton (Christopher George,The Rat Patrol), who tries to find a clue, in the carnage that \\"The Exterminator\\" leaves behind.  The CIA is also involved, and have their own twisted agenda.  When Dalton closes in on Eastland, the Government steps in to close the books on the Exterminator.At the time, Robert Ginty (1948-2009) was mostly known for his work in TV, likeThe Black Sheep Squadron, and The Paper Chase, but he\'s quite good here, playing a man that is compassionate, yet hardened to violence.  The Exterminator works efficiently, without a lot of emotion, as events play out without a lot of pretense.  The story doesn\'t always flow smoothly, the production is a little unpolished, and the ending somewhat forced, but The Exterminator is still a very enjoyable revenge flick.Most of the material restored in the 104 minute unrated director\'s cut, are apparently action or gore related.  A gruesome burned corpse that appears briefly, is really nicely done.  As is the war footage that opens the film, which features a decapitation, and a spectacular fall.  Although the Bluray is probably the best the film will ever look, it is pretty grainy in a number of places.  Robert Ginty has unfortunately passed away, but director James Glickenhaus provides a thoughtful and informative commentary, that puts the film in some context.The success of The Exterminator would result in a sequel, The Exterminator 2 (1984) with Ginty reprising his role.  The film is included in theAction Packed Marathona four film collection.  The sequel has some strange aspects, but the level of violence is amplified, and the flame thrower that is a part of the Exterminator\'s promotional campaign, is more prominently featured.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "robert ginty battles the ghetto ghouls, in the exterminator...", "unixReviewTime": 1376784000, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2013"}\n',

It also has the Twin Fairies (Emi and Ymi Ito), known as the Shobijin in Japan, the little friends of Mothra, which is a clear sign that this is one of those movies where Godzilla is now the good monster instead of the bad monster.  He was clear a bad monster in the original \\"Gojira\\" in 1954 and the following year in \\"Gojira no gyakush.\\"  In 1964\'s \\"Mosura tai Gojira\\" he was still bad, while Mothra was clearly good, while in the 1962 film \\"Kingukongu tai Gojira\\" it depended on what side of the Pacific you lived on.  By the 1970s Godzilla was definitely a good monster, and that transition starts right here.However, Gozilla\'s redemption is not clear a half-hour into the film when the monsters start showing up because the first time we seen Godzilla he is destroying an ocean liner.  Then Rhodan breaks out of the volcano at Mt. Aso and the two of them start having one of their standard fights when Ghidrah shows up on earth, courtesy of a meteor that lands in Korobe Gorge.  Basically what happens at that point is that Mothra convinces the two earth monsters to stop fighting each other and the trio go off to fight Ghidrah.  Clearly if you have a three-headed monster then you need three monsters, one for each head, so you can have three times the fun, although Godzilla is at something of a disadvantage since he is the only one of this quartet that cannot fly.  But screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa can work around that problem, have no fear.  After all this is the guy who wrote the scripts for \\"Mosura tai Gojira,\\" \\"Kaij daisenso,\\" and most of the other Japanese monster movies of the 1960s.Oh, yes, there are also some actual human beings running around in \\"Ghidrah,\\" such as Professor Miura (Hiroshi Koizumi), Mas Selina Salno, Princess of Sergina (Akiko Wakabayashi), and a Chief Assassin (Hisaya Ito).  In fact, the humans are the only ones running around in the first part of the film with all sorts of subplots that are really not going to have much to do with the sudden arrival of a three-headed monster on Earth.  Maybe the whole attempt to assassinate the princess consists of pages from an unsold script that were tossed into this one because you can only have people in rubber suits playing monsters so long before they need a respite.  Besides, there are four monsters, count them, and mere humans cannot compete with that, even with the Twin Fairies appearing on Japanese television.  Ghidrah is really the star of this one because not only does he have three heads, he shoots lightning bolts out of his mouths and makes a neat monster sound.  The fact he has no arms gives him a real distinctive look, but since he has three heads you tend not to notice what is missing because the additional stuff is so captivating.  No wonder he and Godzilla duke it out in five more films, although none of them have all that this first one has going for it.This film was also known as \\"The Biggest Battle on Earth,\\" \\"The Biggest Fight on Earth,\\" \\"The Greatest Battle on Earth,\\" \\"The Greatest Fight on Earth,\\" \\"Three Giant Monsters: The Earth\'s Greatest Decisive Battle,\\" \\"Monster of Monsters,\\" and just plain \\"Ghidrah\\" (I have to admit I sort of miss the old days when studios tried to trick you into seeing the same B-movie more than once by giving it another name). Whatever the title this is a favorite for kids because it offers more monsters and more Tokyo stomping that your average Godzilla film.

Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody\'s talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter\'s, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie. This early picture, though lacking in elegant settings and posh-talk, is vintage; here we having that wonderful skewering of pieties that one remembers from the Marx Brothers. Woody is wonderful at exposing pretensions, great and small. Here he plays a small-time hoodlum, a kind of Sylvester Stallone, played as a clumsy oaf, a loser, and nebbishy klutz, with eyes for the gals. Groucho, where are you? The film is a work of genius.

He begins a life of crime by robbing an armored car, but is quickly caught. In prison, he models a fake gun and tries an unsuccessful escape. Later, in exchange for a pardon, he volunteers for an experimental vaccine, the only side effect is turning him into a rabbi for a few hours. From time to time, his parents are interviewed (wearing  Groucho Marx disguises). Finally released, he rents a room. He then begins another life of crime with purse snatching and small robberies.Intending to steal her purse, Virgil meets a young woman, Louise, who is a laundress, and is smitten. He narrates his nauseous nature when in love. He robs a soda machine for money and goes to dinner on a date with Louise. Now he is in love. Virgil tries to rob a bank - but can\'t write a legible holdup note, and gets arrested and put back in prison, where he gets visits from Louise. Although she says she will wait for Virgil, he plans an escape. The warden gets wind of the plan, so the escaping group calls it off but forgets to tell Virgil, who tries it alone, and improbably escapes.Virgil and Louise get married, and later Louise gets pregnant. Virgil wants to go straight and tries to get job as insurance agent, but is hired instead for the mailroom. He is ferreted out by a co-worker and is blackmailed. Virgil contemplates murdering her, but is unsuccessful in every attempt, including stabbing her with a turkey leg, but finally is accidentally lucky with the exploding candlesticks.Petty crimes follow in his life on the run. He thinks up another bank robbery plot, and unwittingly tells some cops about it but is not arrested. When it comes time to rob the bank, his group is confronted by rival robbers. They are caught, and Virgil gets put in a chain-gang. The group manages to escape while chained together with help from Louise. They are off on a life of crime again, and Virgil makes the \\"Gangster of the Year\\" award. He unwittingly robs a former marching band member, who is now a cop, and is arrested again. He is interviewed in captivity, while working on his next soap-gun.While a little rough around the edges, the movie has some charm and a few giggles.

One who has never read the novel may find the action moving too quickly, so that the flow of the movie may seem slightly abrupt or choppy.

I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.It\'s a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman\'s obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don\'t know and don\'t need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I\'m rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie.The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two\'s struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don\'t speak Japanese can\'t understand what Toshiro Mifune\'s character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune\'s character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn\'t provide me with adequate closure for the two characters\' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn\'t quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as \'Enemy Mine\'.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "40 Years Later, still an awesome movie from legendary director John Boorman.", "unixReviewTime": 1221350400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2008"}\n',

It is undeniably true.  However, he was always a good actor, and even though only Kurosawa could pull the greatness from him, any Mifune performance is worth checking out.  His American-directed attempts are usually even poorer than his quickly-done super-samurai slugfests, but \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" is an exception to the rule.  This is good stuff.The story is not exactly innovative.  It was done four years earlier in the Frank Sinatra flick,None But the Brave, which was also a Japanese-American collaboration.  However, whereas Sinatra had an entire platoon to back him up when making a tentative truce with the stranded Japanese castaways, in \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" there are only two, Lee Marvin and Mifune Toshiro.  Lost on an unpopulated island, the two enemies must first fight, then carve out a grudging respect as they realize the desperateness of their plight, and how little wars mean when there are only two people in existence.This is a brave and innovative film.  Marvin and Mifune are the only two actors, and everything was filmed on location.  There are no mourning wives waiting for a hopeful return, no platoon of buddies still out looking, no volleyball sidekick.  We aren\'t even entirely sure how they both arrived there.  None of Mifune\'s lines are subtitled, so the frustration of communication is powerful, both for the viewer and for Marvin\'s character.

Pick, whose only other claim to fame is being the screenwriter of the Dean Martin, Matt Helm movie, The Wrecking Crew.  That aside this is a well made film with a great story.  Filmed on location in the Tyrol area of Italy, these natural and scenic backdrops add historical credibility to this film, as well as providing breathtaking views.The story is about a Captain, played brilliantly by Michael Caine, in charge of a group of multi-national mercineries during the 17th Century Thirty Years War.  It is also about a wanderer, seeker, and a man escaping from the ravages of war, Vogel, played by Omar Sharif.  There is also a large international supporting cast, who all do their part, most notable being Nigel Davenport as the Village elder, Per Oscarsson as the village priest, and Arthur O\'Connell, most known for his part on the 70\'s TV show, Chico and the Man.What started out as Religious Wars, mainly in what is present day Germany, and Alpine Valleys quickly turned into political jocking by petty German Princes, the Holy Roman Emporer, the Kings of France, Sweden, and Denmark.  Added to all this war destruction were outbreaks of the plague.  The film does a wonderful job with reconstructing this historical backdrop, even with minor details, like when the village priest asks one of the soldiers \\"Are you a Lutheran Protestant, a Calvin Protestant, or God forbid a heretical Anabaptist or Satan worshiper.\\"  While the Catholics and Protestants, throughout the 17th century, had a love-hate relationship, to put it mildly, the both agreed on their disdain for all things Anabaptist (present day Mennonites, Amish and Hutterites.)Michael Caine, as the Captain, plays a freebooting leader of a religiously mixed group of mercenaries, who wreak havoc and destruction on any city, town, or village in their way.  They have two rules, the Captain calls the shots, and they are not allowed to discuss religion.  Omar Sharif plays Vogel, an educated wanderer, all too familiar with the ravages of this hypocritical war.  He has been running from it for 20 years.  Things are so bad, that even gold and silver, have lost their appeal.  All people want is peace and the ability to farm their small part of the world.  The film opens with an emaciated Vogel wandering into a small village trying to purchase food and shelter, not seconds later, rumbling down the moutains into the valley are the Captains soldiers, who burn, pillage, and rape with abandon, and some with a self-imposed blessing by God in their warrior pursuits.  So, once again Vogel is forced to run, over mountains and valleys until he comes by a deserted, idyllic, little village in a naturally protected valley.  But, his peace doesn\'t last long before the Captain arrives in the same place.  They find the villagers hiding in the mountains.  Vogel convinces the captain that this, little piece of paradise, would make a great place to winter over, and he being educated could act as the go-between soldier and peasants.  I don\'t want to give more away, but against the backdrop of war, fanatical religion, lust, and a search for peace this story continues to unfold.This is a great movie, running, 2 hours and 5 minutes.  Michael Caine is brilliant as the pragmatic, unbelieving warrior.  Omar Sharif, as a kind of naive 17th century, Parsifal, plays off of Caine\'s cynicism and hatred of all things religious and political.  There is great inter-personal relationships in this film also.This movie should be shown in all world history classes as it provides a great tool for what life was like during the Thirty Years War.  5 Stars Plus for this wonderful movie.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Period Film Well Made", "unixReviewTime": 1164326400, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2006"}\n',

Clavell\'s choice of Europe in the midst of one of the worst calamities to befall Western Civilization was done because this time and place, along with the Thirty Years War, was the crucible from which the modern world emerged...the modern territorial state, sovereignty, secularism, humanism, etc.  You do not have to look very hard to find references to these issues in the film.  But beyond that, there are universal isssues here.  True, there is a reaction to the war in Vietnam, America\'s worst foreign policy calamity, as there are numerous reactions to other anxieties of that time, relgion, superstition, inhumanity and humanity, and, of course, war.  A national news magazine, at the time, ran the headline &quot; Is God Dead?&quot;  Richard M.

   '{"reviewerID": "A3O536E2YOKK4Y", "asin": "0764005022", "reviewerName": "Wuchak", "helpful": [22, 22], "reviewText": "I was at the store and spied this unknown 1971 flick amongst the DVDs; it looked like my kind of movie, especially with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif, so I naturally wondered why I had never heard of it. I made a mental note to check out some reviews on the internet. The across-the-board high ratings piqued my interest, so I decided to pick it up the next time I saw it.The first thing that made a favorable impression was the outstanding opening credits sequence. Many reviewers mention John Barry\'s magnificent score as a highlight and they\'re right. This credits sequence innovatingly depicts the theme of the Thirty Years War -- members of essentially the same religion at each other\'s throats.THE STORY: During the horrible Thirty Years War in Europe (1618-1648) a band of mercenaries led by the merciless Michael Caine (\\"The Captain\\") and a drifter attempting to flee the horrors of the war discover a hidden vale -- the last valley untouched by the war. The drifter talks The Captain into wintering in the peaceful valley rather than pillaging it and raping/killing the villagers. (This setup itself is a hint that this is no ordinary war flick).WHAT WORKS: Parts of the film have a dreamy, surreal atmosphere, particularly the beginning and ending; this is reminiscent of the incomparable \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" Michael Caine is outstanding as The Captain, a character so hardened by the horrors of war that he no longer even has a name, he\'s just \\"The Captain.\\" Caine would perform a similar role in the underrated \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" in 1977, a stunning performance. The Captain\'s answer to everything was to simply kill, but now, in the valley, he has found peace and the warmth of love. Omar Sharif also perfectly depicts the disillusioned drifter, Vogel, his reaction to the horrors of war has always been to run, but in the valley he also finds peace and love, and even -- maybe -- a family? The depth and ultra-seriousness of the story, including the dialogue of the characters touching on issues of war, loss, God, religion, ignorance, superstitions, love, hope, loyalty, duty, redemption, etc. truly separate this pic from an ordinary war-adventure yarn.It\'s also very interesting to observe how people lived in a regular hamlet 400 years ago in backwoods Europe. It was not unusual for people back then in such circumstances to live their entire lives within 10 miles or so from where they were born. Such people would likely be under-educated, superstitious, innocent, ignorant and narrow-minded all at the same time, and the film realistically portrays this.WHAT DOESN\'T WORK: There are parts of the film that aren\'t pulled off very well. Some of the dramatic stagings and dialogue come off awkward here and there. These aspects perhaps needed more fine-tuning and this explains why critics originally panned the movie and why it fell into obscurity for thirty years (a fitting curse for being the only movie to ever address the Thirty Years War, eh?).Some have criticized the film for being anti-church or even anti-God. Actually the film\'s about the pursuit of God, truth, love and happiness in the face of the ultimate horror -- war. And not just any war, a war that lasted three decades wherein innocent civilians -- men, women, children & family members -- were needlessly slaughtered. The repugnance and terror of war caused The Captain to become a ruthless atheist, as he declares in one potent scene, and \\"tore the heart out of\\" Vogel, as revealed in another. But the last valley untouched by the neverending conflict has given them both hope again.***SPOILER ALERT***Originally The Captain was going to slay Vogel as soon as he met him, but after wintering in the valley he sets Vogel up as the leader while he leaves to attend to the business of war. He obviously had a change of heart concerning Vogel. In any event, he returns to the vale, wounded, his only sanctuary from the evils of battle and plague. His dying words to Vogel are: \\"Vogel, if you find God tell him we created...\\" He was no longer an atheist in the strictest sense; he now even hoped their was a Creator and WANTED Vogel to find truth, love & happiness. But it was too late for him. Or maybe not?***END SPOILER***FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite the obvious flaws the film gets a huge \'A\' for effort in my book. \\"The Last Valley\\" is a special picture. It successfully creates a small world of people some 400 years ago in a secluded vale in the paradisical wilderness of the Alps. A world you can get lost in for 2 hours. The originality of the story and its inherent profundities, not to mention the fine cast, performances and surreal aspects, lift the film above a simple adventure yarn. It\'s unorthodox, enlightening, thought-provoking and ultimately moving. If you enjoy films like \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Runaway Train,\\" films that boldly attempt to go far deeper than the run-of-the-mill action/adventure flick, then be sure to check out \\"The Last Valley.\\" You won\'t be disappointed. In addition, it\'s a film you\'ll continue to glean from in future viewings. But, since this is a dialogue-driven picture, be sure to use the subtitles so you can understand the heavily accented dialogue. You\'ll get much more out of it.GRADE: A-", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WHOA!", "unixReviewTime": 1096070400, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2004"}\n',

DeRiemer", "helpful": [18, 18], "reviewText": "London Police Detective Albert Tyburn (Trevor Eve) may have taken justice into his own hands. He tracked down an influential, wealthy member of parliament, a pedophile, in the act of abusing an 11 year old boy. The man taunted Tyburn that he couldn\'t be touched, and then pulled out a pistol and took a shot. He missed. Tyburn took out his pistol, took careful aim and deliberately killed the man. For his act, Tyburn was told he had two choices. Resign from the police or accept a new position of police superintendent in Nairobi, about as far from London as his superiors could send him.So in 1931 Tyburn arrives in Kenya to take up his new post. His superior, Police Commissioner Burkitt (Michael Burne), is a red-faced martinet of the old school, dedicated to upholding the empire and not stepping on the toes of \\"our class.\\" Tyburn quickly finds that Nairobi\'s upper class is a privileged mix of wealth, condescension, bigotry, drugs, adultery, alcoholism and occasional buggery. Enforcement of the law is designed to keep the lower classes in their place. Tyburn has his work cut out for him.Heat of the Sun is a well made and well acted series of mysteries which take place in a much different time and setting than we\'re used to. Trevor Eve plays Tyburn as an experienced cop who is not impressed by the upper classes and doesn\'t mind pushing things if that\'s what it takes to find a criminal. Eve is a strong actor and is no pretty boy. He\'s a bit on the beefy side, and looks like he\'d be more comfortable downing a beer than sipping a martini. The series is made up of three mysteries: Private Lives, which establishes Tyburn in Nairobi and puts him in the midst of murder and adultery amongst the elite; Hide in Plain Sight, where he goes up against a kidnapping ring; and The Sport of Kings, where Tyburn takes on a bigoted press lord and finds more secrets than he bargained for.In my view, the setting, the time frame, the acting, and the prodding of the privileged make this an enjoyable show. Unfortunately, while it was reasonably popular when shown in the U.S., it made much less of an impression in Britain. A second set of three mysteries was never commissioned. If you want to see Trevor Eve\'s range as an actor, watch him in The Politician\'s Wife. He plays the politician, and is charming, reprehensible and a liar.There\'s not much by way of extras.

Edward Herrmann (who I normally find an unbearably annoying actor)  is quite good as a pastor who finds himself fighting organized crime when  one of his church members gambles away church money.  (True, he should be  angry at the church member, but our reverend believes in tackling the ROOT  of the problem).  After Herrmann speaks out against organized crime  publicly, two FBI agents come to him and ask him for his help in going  undercover to expose these gangsters.

Seeking to get his congregation more involved with the day to day activities of the church, Reverend Hill\'s first act is to delegate the church\'s sinking fund to Rose Delaney (Patsy Kelly), suggesting she come up with ideas of how to bring more money into the fund. But when Rose\'s husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) - a compulsive gambler - gets his hands on the money and puts it all on a horse instead, Reverend Hill takes it upon himself to hightail it over to the local bookie to get it back ... but is just in time to see the entire fund lost when Delaney\'s horse doesn\'t come in.Hill reports the gambling operation to the local police - who, viewers soon learn, are on the take and in the pocket of the local mob bosses. And when Reverend Hill gets hot under the collar and blurts out the town\'s gambling/crime problem on local television, Hill gets the attention of both the Treasury Department ... and the crime bosses determined not to lose their very profitable operation. When none of his male parishioners will help to try and break up the gambling ring, Hill (and the feds) are forced instead to rely on the only volunteers they have - five church ladies who want to clean up their town in between kids and beauty shop appointments and little league games.And as the five ladies are comprised of Patsy Kelly, Barbara Harris, Cloris Leachman, Karen Valentine, and Virginia Capers, things get pretty hilarious when the ladies\' first efforts are botched completely, and the mob eventually figures out what they are trying to do.This is one of those films that can be a bit over the top at times, but at heart is a wonderful, feel-good comedy with some excellent moments, and wonderful performances, especially by Barbara Harris, Ruth Buzzi as a CB-wielding church elder, and in particular the one-and-only Cloris Leachman, who steals a few scenes with ease (including one, regarding the destruction of her fingernails, that is downright hilarious).

PHENOMENA is the original, uncut version of the film directed by Horror legend Dario Argento (SUSPIRIA, MOTHER OF TEARS, etc.). It\'s basically about a girl named Jennifer (played by a young Jennifer Connelly) who is sent to a boarding school in Germany while her father is filming a movie in the Phillipines. While there, a bunch of murders take place involving young girls, some of whom are her schoolmates. Turns out she has the ability to communicate with insects and she utilizes her weird talent to help track down the killer, thus leading her to something truly evil and disturbing.There were two things that made me love this movie: the beautiful cinematography and the music. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, especially for a Horror movie. Dario Argento is known for using color schemes in his films (SUSPIRIA and INFERNO are two that come to mind) and PHENOMENA is no different. A lot of whites and blues and greens are used early on in the film to create a calm, dream-like atmosphere, and then as the film draws to a conclusion, a lot of reds are used to create a nightmarish setting. The visuals in this film are just awesome. The music is also great. It\'s total synth-heavy 80\'s style music with even some Heavy Metal thrown in (Iron Maiden\'s \\"Flash of the Blade\\" is used prominently in the film as the killer\'s unofficial theme song). I also liked this movie for a lot of other reasons. Jennifer Connelly being one of them. I\'ve always been a big fan of hers and it\'s cool to see her early on in her career in a film like this. When most people think of young Jennifer, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA and especially LABYRINTH come to mind and this Horror film is often overlooked. Donald Pleasance stars in the film as a wheelchair-bound man who studies insects who is sort of a mentor to Jennifer.As far as the story, it\'s just crazy. It\'s a Giallo style killer movie with supernatural elements thrown in. Without spoiling anything, let me just describe the ending. Basically, it\'s one of the craziest endings I\'ve ever seen in a movie. There\'s a homicidal deformed little boy, a straight-razor wielding chimpanzee, a giant swarm of bees, a disgusting pit of corpses and maggots, a scene similar to the ending of the firstFRIDAY THE 13THmovie (remember young Jason jumping out of the lake?), a decapitation, and numerous false endings. And that\'s only in the last ten or fifteen minutes!I highly recommend PHENOMENA. It\'s just a good, old school Horror film with a lot of good, cheesy 80\'s music, a lot of cool visuals, and some pretty gruesome scenes. It even has some unintentionally funny dialogue and overdubs (it\'s an Italian movie... they filmed it in English but they still overdubbed the voices for some reason). I\'m still exploring Dario Argento\'s filmography, but I have yet to come across a bad one and PHENOMENA is definitely my favorite so far.4.5 stars", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Jennifer Connelly communicates with insects to help find a maniacal killer... need I say more??", "unixReviewTime": 1229644800, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2008"}\n',

Things aren\'t all well, as eight months ago, a schoolgirl\'s head was found, and others have vanished since.Jennifer\'s not your ordinary girl.  For one thing, she has a great rapport with insects.  She loves them and they feel comfortable around her.  A retired instructor and entomologist, Dr. John McGregor, who befriends her, tells her that it\'s \\"normal for insects to be slightly telepathic\\"--hence their attraction to her.  But is it normal for her, she asks?  In one instance, her presence calms the insects in his lab.  She\'s also a somnabulist in times of stress and change.  In fact it is one of these nighttime walks that leads her to the doctor.Her roommate Sophie then vanishes, and with the help of a firefly, finds a glove that might have been worn by the killer.  McGregor, convinced that the killer might have kept remains of his victim where he lives, encourages Jennifer to seek him out with the help of the Great Sarcophagus, a fly that can find a corpse from long distances.  \\"You\'re in a position to do extraordinary things.\\" he tells her, listing her and the fly as \\"the two greatst detective ever known.  That fly is your magic wand.\\"There are some revisits to old themes:  e.g. schoolgirls being murdered (Suspiria), strict headmistresses (Suspiria) decapitations (Deep Red), underwater sequences (Inferno), and attack by animal hordes (again Inferno).  The best effect involves hoardes of flies surrounding one side of the school, coming when Jennifer\'s in distress.  In a behind the scenes documentary after the movie, special visual effects man Luigi Cozzi explains how they did that shot.There are two music videos using footage both used and not used in the movie.  They are of Goblin\'s Claudio Simonetti, which features an operatic female voice and a racing techno number.  Another is Bill Wyman, (yes, THAT Bill Wyman) and his stark instrumental number \\"Valley\\" which uses scenes of Jennifer in the mysterious house and the Danish tourist who is killed.  Finally, there\'s an interview with Argento on the Joe Franklin Show, where despite being touted as someone who out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock, makes the point that his styles are different, which they are.Daria Niccolodi (Miss Bruchner) doesn\'t have much screen time and isn\'t as appealing or sympathetic as she was in her previous Argento movies.  Donald Pleasance is the only other appealing character here as McGregor.This movie does have Argento\'s usual hallmarks of psychological horror, gory deaths and blood, but it pales when compared to Suspiria or Inferno.

I will have to check that out some time because less might actually be more in the case of this particular film.  I say that because I was ready to give up on this movie because halfway through the DVD kept coming to a stop.  I kept taking it out, cleaning it and blowing into the player, over and over again in an attending to get the offending dust mote or whatever.  Just before I decided to send the DVD back because I had no compelling reason to watch the rest of the film, I tried it on a different DVD player and found out that this horror film has an ending that you have to see in order to believe.\\"Phenomena\\" begins with a young girl (the director\'s daughter Fiore) getting off of a bus somewhere in the Swiss Alps and getting killed.  Fans of Argento knows he likes heads to break glass when people are getting killed and that happens for the first of two times in this film.  Eight months later Inspector Geiger (Patrick Bauchau) is still working the case, one of a string of murders, and consulting with Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasance), a wheelchair-bound insect specialist who knows all about what insects do to human corpses.  Then we meet 13-year-old Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly in her first lead role), who has been sent by her parents to a private girls academy.  Having an American movie star for a parent cuts no slack with the other girls, who ridicule Jennifer for being a sleepwalker who likes bugs.  The headmistress of the school denounces Jennifer as a \\"Lady of the Flies\\" while the local doctor is worried that Jennifer\'s sleepwalking is the first step towards developing a split personality (really, this is their diagnosis).  When the girls torment Jennifer she calls all of the insects around the school to her aid and you are thinking that what Argento is doing here is a variation of \\"Carrie,\\" where the tormented girl with the strange powers turns the table of her tormenters.  But there is still that unknown killer running around and Argento has no intention of taking full advantage of this strange little power.After getting the necessary explanations and exposition from Prof. McGregor, Jennifer actually uses one of her insect friends to find the spot along the bus route where the first girl was killed, which is rather original.  This is where the DVD I was watching started giving me headaches and I was ready to just give up on the film, because the only part that had really caught my attention was the chimpanzee that keeps Prof. McGregor company and who was stealing the movie from the human cast.  But I am certainly glad I watched the rest of \\"Phenomena\\" because that chimp has two of the better scenes in the entire movie and Argento pulls out all of the stops for the big finish.  The endgame of this film really erupts given how relatively tame the rest of the film has been up to this point.  There is a little bit of everything here in the effort to totally turn your stomach (I have to wonder if the makers of \\"Saw III\\" happened to catch this movie because of what Inspector Gieger does).The result is not even close to being a great film because the weaving together of the science fiction and horror elements is quite uneven, but then there comes a scene like the one where the chimp goes after a Japanese carp kite stuck in a tree on a moonlight night and suddenly I am really pay attention.  By the time Jennifer is following that phone cord the gloves are off.  I do not know if this is the one Dario Argento film you should see if you only see one of his macabre little films, but at the very least the last act of this film will definitely give you something to talk about.  I decided to round up on \\"Phenomena,\\" but it could well be that whoever edited it down to \\"Creepers\\" helped the slow first half of this film so it could well be that the butchered American version ends up being a solid four.  If and when I check it out I will remember to come back here and render a verdict on that score.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Force yourself to sit through the slow stuff to get to Argento\'s endgame", "unixReviewTime": 1175126400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2007"}\n',

His style should be known by now and again his use of camera shots and colours are quite effective in this film.  A daughter of a popular movie star is the protagonist in this film as she can see visions and control insects to solve, yet again, like David Hemmings in Deep Red, a series of brutal killings in Switzerland.  Donald Pleasance adds the contemporary English prescence as does Jessica Connelly as the American student plagued with sleep walking disorders and out of control telekinetic powers, hence that this movie was directed at American audiences.  Again, Dario Argento presents to us a situation out of control and tries to show how those who are involved in them try to cope with them.  In this case &lt;I cannot reveal all&gt; a murderer is loose trying to cover up the crimes of a supposed pyschopath.  Only Dario Argento can use lighting and wind effects to show a mood and he does this so well while conveying a story. This is a very moody film, a bit dark in places, but again that sets the tone for the mind of the killer.  Jessica uses her telekinesis to full effect to find a brutal murderer and succeeds in spades, up to and almost including her own life.  The characters are a bit woody in places, as they really are just props in this film, but the overall affect is pure horror and a showcase for more grisly death scenes.

The killer seems to be on a mission, killing off people (mostly women) who are morally corrupt and are referred to by the killer as \\"deviants\\".This blood-soaked, fast-moving Argento flick is not in the same classic level as his masterpiece \\"Suspiria\\" or even \\"Deep Red\\" but his fans seem to love it regardless. The film is not really a horror film but a sexually charged detective thriller with an attractive cast, solid acting (although some of the dubbing is pretty annoying), creative camera angles (typical in an Argento film) and lot\'s of blood (again, typical of an Argento film).

The entire cast is made up of photogenic, elegant actors; Daria Nicolodi, Mirella D\'Angelo, Anthony Franciosa, John Saxon, Ania Pieroni and a whole array of exotic European beauties. Argento also uses the color red effectively throughout this film; bright red lipstick, red stilettos, red cars, countless scenes of gleaming red blood. It takes someone like Dario Argento to make blood look so beautiful on screen.This film was released in North America in a heavily edited form and under the insane title of \\"Unsane\\".

It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director\'s films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn\'t too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director\'s beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento\'s films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with \\"The Stendhal Syndrome\\" and \\"Sleepless.\\" \\"Tenebrae\\" was Argento\'s first \\"return\\" to the giallo genre, after he strayed into the supernaturally themed \\"Suspiria\\" and \\"Inferno.\\"I happen to think \\"Tenebrae\\" may well be the best Argento film I have seen, even better than his first wave of gialli. It\'s the story of Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa), a popular writer of disturbing novels who travels to Italy to promote his latest thriller. Unfortunately for Neal, and more so for several other people, a killer decides to imitate the murders laid out in the author\'s most recent book. It isn\'t too long before the local police, in the form of Detective Germani (Giuliano Gemma), make the connection between the homicides and Neal\'s book. With his assistant Anna (Daria Nicolodi), book agent Bullmer (John Saxon), and a young man named Gianni (Christian Borromeo) standing by his side, the popular novelist soon joins the investigation into these grisly crimes. And grisly they are as only Dario Argento can make them. We see throat slashings, stabbings, a hand liberated from a wrist, and other gooey surprises shot in the sort of alarming, extreme close up that is a trademark of this director\'s brand of cinematic carnage. \\"Tenebrae\\" constitutes one of Argento\'s most disturbingly violent escapades into the giallo genre. It is, fortunately, one of his most coherent films as well.Neal continues to promote his book even as he helps the police in the hunt for the killer. He faces a slew of protests about the supposedly misogynistic, ultra violent content of his novels from an angry female protestor and from a smarmy television critic on one of those face-to-face talk shows. Both of Neal\'s critics perish horribly soon after (surprise, surprise), thus throwing some suspicion on the author himself as a prime suspect. Of course, many others could very well be the ones putting on the black gloves. The only real clue we get from Argento, if you can call it that, is a weird flashback of a young woman tormenting a boy with her red-heeled shoes. As creepy carnival style music plays throughout the flashback, we then see the focus shift to the killer stepping out from behind a hedgerow to stab the woman. What this memory means, and why we see it from the perspective of the killer, soon emerges as \\"Tenebrae\\" draws to its ultra shocking conclusion. And the conclusion is shocking, containing some of the most graphic gore I\'ve seen as well as a truly gasp worthy revelation I won\'t elaborate on here except to say other films (\\"Nightmares in a Damaged Brain\\" comes to mind) have used it to great effect. \\"Tenebrae\\" is a real treat for the horror fan.Apparently, \\"Tenebrae\\" came about after a crazed fan stalked Dario Argento. Whatever the impetus for making this film, the result is one of the director\'s most entertaining excursions into the realms of horror. Aside from the graphic gore, we also get the requisite Argento photographic style. Check out that crane shot of the outside of the apartment building, a shot that runs on forever while building the suspense up to a fever pitch. Then there\'s the great chase scene with the dog, and the murder of the television critic that we see through the windows of his house. Argento truly achieves a masterful vision of mayhem with \\"Tenebrae.\\" The performances, although dubbed in spots, are darn effective too. Franciosa does a great job playing the happy go lucky Peter Neal, and it\'s always great to see John Saxon in another horror film (even if he does spend a lot of time messing around with that confounded hat!). \\"Tenebrae\\" also ratchets up the suspense by employing yet another mesmerizing synthesizer score from Goblin. The music heard doing those flashback sequences ranks as one of the eeriest bits of music I\'ve ever heard in a horror movie. Yes sir, \\"Tenebrae\\" worked on nearly every level for this genre fan.Dario Argento would go on to make several non-giallo films after \\"Tenebrae\\" (\\"Phenomena\\" starring a young Jennifer Connolly among them) before heading back to his roots again. None of his recent black-gloved nightmare thrillers, however, can match the pounding intensity of this movie. Extras on the DVD include a commentary track, an alternate end credits music piece, and a couple of behind the scenes looks at the film. Less here than on other discs, perhaps, but the movie is so good you won\'t care. I\'m starting to get a little sad since I\'m running out of Argento films to watch for the first time.

I have to agree I enjoy these very much. He can be very slick. His movie \\"Tenebre\\" is actually fairly well constructed. It is about an American novelist Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) who came to Rome to promote his book only to be mired in the tragic deaths of many beautiful women. Seemingly based on his recent novel the girls (and others) all die horrific deaths with Argento\'s arsenal of ways to kill pretty Italian girls. Three very memorable scenes in this movie to my mind, and a recurring theme of deep human despair which I have found in his movies so far. Two scenes here which specifically communicate this sense of futility. The first of which involves eight or maybe nine if you go back all the way to the introduction of the minor character involved turns of fate in a lengthy and relentless sequence characteristic of Argento\'s films and for which I can see why he is sometimes compared to Hitchcock (though is it appropriate to do so???). It is a turning point in the film. I am reminded of the scene with the pile of razor wire in \\"Suspiria\\". The other scene in \\"Tenebre\\" more graphically identifies that theme in the image of a character impaled on a polished piece of metal, trying to pull it out but his hands are too slippery with blood to grip the object.Stylistically speaking the movie departs from garish and moody lighting of \\"Suspiria\\" for a more frontal, \\"realistic\\" look. If that hallucinogenic quality is the only thing a person liked about those movies. Interestingly enough, people complain that it looks like a TV show and the commentary notes that Argento was looking into the lighting of American television police drama to incorporate into this film. Don\'t mistake, color is still important. You will notice there is a lot of white so that when someone gets killed.... The other Argento trademarks are here, and effectively so. Camera movement, cutting, and soundtrack are still extremely important. The soundtrack is by three of the members of Goblin and, while of course sounding dated, fits very well, especially in one scene where you hear probably the whole main theme played over the duration of a long elaborate crane shot. I\'m still amazed that in a movie where sound is so important I am able to forgive mediocre dubbing.If you ever find yourself trying to argue that Argento isn\'t a misogynistic film director, make sure you try and sway the conversation away from this film. The vast majority of sick violence is directed at the fairer sex, but never mind! The murders are typically well orchestrated, and it is obvious which part of his film that Argento values the most.

By this point Argento was so well versed in the sub-genres conventions that TENBRE has an effortless feel about it, the sense that the director was hardly stretching his innumerable talents. The film has a nice allegorical feel in its exploration of the effects of violence in the media on people. In this case it is not a film, but a novel. Argento is clever to divert attention away from the medium of cinema. At the time of the films release just such arguments about violence were reaching an apex, especially in the UK where TENEBRE was actually banned due to its violent content and the influence such imagery might have.From a visual perspective Argento goes to the extreme opposite of his previous two films, by presenting a bright and starkly lit world, this brightness is taken to its extremity when one character played by JOHN SAXON is stabbed to death in broad daylight. The film works well, because of a confusing narrative structure, which is punctuated by flashbacks, which is what one expects from a giallo. If it makes sense, then arguably it has failed. As usual the film is filled with tremendous set pieces, including an astonishing sequence where Argento shoots a house from every conceivable angle in one take. A scene which is disturbing because of the almost omnipotent quality of the gaze of the killer. The Rome location is evocative and surprising in the rather dour and dreary impression it gives.Sadly the broader themes of the film are not dealt with in a particularly intelligent and sensitive way and half way through the film Argento loses patience and begins despatching cast members with clockwork regularity. Performances are above average for an Italian horror production as is the soundtrack. Considering the way Argento deteriorated as the 80\'s became the 90\'s, TENEBRE stands as one of the directors better films.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Triumphant return to Giallo for Argento!", "unixReviewTime": 1150934400, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2006"}\n',

Bala \\"Me Too Can Read\\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "Nowadays Demons might be looked upon as merely an Italian cinematic curio or maybe just a typical - even derivative - example of the horror flicks that saturated the 1980s. But when it was first released in 1986, Demons upped the ante in the genre of the macabre, in terms of shock and gore. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero\'s, these creatures were quick, but just as relentless. The sheer abandonment with which the demons went after their prey was stupefying to watch for a teenager like I was. There was an atmosphere of impending doom that was palpable throughout the film. I just saw Demons again for the first time in almost a decade, and while it\'s lost a bit of its luster for me, I still found it vastly entertaining. In my viewing of horror flicks, I don\'t look for detailed explanations, just a modicum of logic in an illogical genre. This film fits the bill. Demons is a mishmash of cheesy exposition, stilted acting, moist and  grisly demonic transformations, and prerequisite monster chases and graphic disfigurements. Not too shabby. In fact, it\'s the perfect dvd to throw in when you have sarcastic friends over.The skimpy plot goes something like this: Complimentary tickets for a film screening are being passed out by a sinister man sporting a metallic half mask. Cut then to the dilapidated movie palace The Metropol and its smattering of movie goers. The screening begins and the movie being shown turns out to be  a creepy horror flick about demons being raised and overrunning the world. As the movie unreels, scenes in the picture begin to parallel the goings-on in the audience. Soon enough, demons are ravaging and rending their frantic victims both on the screen and in the panic-filled theatre, which instantly becomes an abattoir.As I\'ve said, in a by-the-number gorefest such as this, I tend to tolerate quite a bit. However, I do think the dead-end subplot of the coke-snorting hooligans who come in late to the picture is unnecessary. But it\'s a minor quibble. Demons  was the first collaboration between director Lamberto Bava and producer Dario Argento, and their combined expertise in the genre turns Demons into a slick, sanguinary monster classic, laden with moments of sheer blood and guts carnage. The professionally-done monster effects, while not up to snuff with our current CGI stuff, were state of the art back then. The hard rock/heavy metal soundtrack also adds to the effluvium of menace and immediacy. For a horrificly good time, this film is wildly  recommended!By the way, the special features offer a pretty interesting film audio commentary done in part by director Lamberto Bava, who speaks in both English and Italian.

Wylie about a \\"family\\" of shallow scoundrels who find that pretending to be decent isn\'t really all that difficult. A sharp and funny screenplay by Paul Osborne and a playful score from Franz Waxman make this one of David O. Selznick\'s best productions. A 1930\'s cast that dreams are made of includes Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Janet Gaynor, Paulette Goddard, Richard Carlson, Roland Young, Billie Burke, Henry Stephenson, and Minnie Dupree as Miss Fortune.Our group of rascals are on the French Riviera about to get rich when they are politely asked to get out of town by the police. Rick (Douglass Fairbanks Jr.) was about to marry rich and put the family in the black for life. His \\"sister\\" George-Anne (Janet Gaynor) had just discovered too late that her mark, Duncan Macrae (Richard Carlson), wasn\'t wealthy at all. He did give her a ring that has been held in his family for years, but she can\'t understand why thinking about him makes her cry. Rick is wide-eyed at her musings about people who actually marry for love, and in an hilarious moment in which she is trying to understand her melancholy, she tells Rick: \\"How can I be in love with him? He hasn\'t any money!\\"Roland Young is the father, Sahib, who poses as a former Bengal Lancer, and Billie Burke is the mother, \\"Marmy.\\" She can barely keep up with her husband\'s yarns of India, and at one point in the film tells a group that Rick and George-Anne were born there but she\'s never been, but would like to go one day!Given train tickets to London just to get them off the Riviera, George-Anne is shocked to discover that Duncan, despite having been made aware of what they were doing, has followed her. He thinks she\'s not like the rest of her family and can be \\"cured\\" and she tries to convince him for the rest of the film that she\'s just as worthless as they are! Trying to lose him, George-Anne meets a kind, sweethearted but lonely old lady named, appropriately enough, Miss Fortune. She is looking for a family to love and when they discover she is wealthy, they warm up to her in a big hurry.George-Anne and Rick save her life when the train wrecks and soon they are all staying in her huge home, \\"working\\" her until she changes her will and they are set for life. George-Anne has gone a bit soft though, and as the others take--gulp--jobs, so they can pretend to be normal people, they slowly discover that they really want to be what the kind Miss Fortune (Minnie Dupree) thinks they are.Duncan, still trying to win over George-Anne, gets Sahib a job selling cars. He tries to refuse it in a very funny scene but George-Anne forces him to accept the offer. Since it\'s pretty much the same thing as a con, he is so successful at it he becomes the head of the London branch! The very fast car he sells is called The Flying Wombat!Rick, meanwhile, discovers the pretty Leslie Saunders (Paulette Goddard) and charms her into giving him a job as a mail sorter. She begins to wear on him and he starts reading about engineering. When he is honest with her about what he and his family are doing, she is disturbed by his seeming lack of regret for how they are using Miss Fortune. Leslie isn\'t quite sure it\'s all an act, however, and she may be right.Miss Fortune has grown on all of them and Rick begins to wonder if they\'ve actually become decent people and are no longer just pretending. When Miss Fortune has a serious spell and it is discovered she may not have her wealth anymore, the truth might just come out.Fairbanks and Gaynor are wonderful here, and would stand out even more were it not for the equally endearing performances from the rest of the cast. This is a fabulous classic with a very special mood. It is sweet, hilarious, sentimental, and full to the brim with charm. I can\'t recommend this film any higher or I would. This is not a rental.

But what is particually discusting is his language:\\"Under a shaggy Muslim beard\\"Congratulations Amazon on one of the worst examples of racist stereotyping I have read since Enid Blyton\'s \'gollywog\' character. There was I thinking that this kind of racism had died out over 30 years ago only to find it prominently displayed at amazon (I should point out here I made the same complaint to amazon.co.uk and had no response. Seems Muslims and ethnic minorities are fair game again these days)The film itself does suffer from some poor displays especially from seasoned actors such as Oliver Reed while Anthony Quinn (under his \'shaggy Muslim beard\' (sorry but that phrase is just so openly racist it frankly discusts and enrages me)) is exellent in the role of Umar al-Mukhtar. It is facinating to see the tactics that his men used against the militarily far superior Italian forces and also the barbaric response that the Italians made against them.It should be pointed out that Amazons synopsis is also wrong. Umar al-Mukhtar was the leader of resistance for the Sanusi Sufi order which was led by the grand Sanusi who was in exile in Egypt (Umar al-Mukhtar was orded to take up arms by his Sheikh and not simply the leader of a band of men who take up arms as amazon\'s synopsis would have you believe). The Sanusi order which originally was a peacefull order speading Islam in the Sub Sahara through education and the opening of schools next to their \'Zawiyas\' was forced into military action by the agressive policies of first the French and then the Italians. It should also be pointed out that they also fought along side the Ottomans in the first world war and their Sheikh was a significant leader in the Turkish war of independence. This should give the veiwer an idea that this film is of far more importance than just a \\"curiosity for those wanting to learn more about Lybian history\\"This film deplicts one of the darkest periods of Italian history and regardless of who financed the film it is an important document of a period of history Italy has tried to hide. I would equally like to see a film documenting the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.I would also recomend the books desert encouter by K Holmboe and Omar al-Mukhtar by Enzo Santarelli for further reading both published by Darf publications. The book \'Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad also has some mention of the Sanusi order, Umar al-Mukhtar and the role that the Sanusis played in the Turkish war of independence.This film deserves 5 stars as it stands as one of the only cinematic documents of this period of history.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Shame on you amazon", "unixReviewTime": 1123977600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2005"}\n',

Instead of piling on the blood and gore, like too many horror films after HALLOWEEN would do, THE CAR is more of a suspense shocker based on supernatural themes, predating the Stephen King-based CHRISTINE by six years.As has been mentioned, THE CAR is a long, black, and quite frankly evil limousine that has its sights set on the town of Santa Ynez in southwestern Utah.  James Brolin is the town\'s deputy sheriff who must cope with and stop this limousine before it kills any more people (in the film\'s opening sequence, it actually kills two cyclists in Zion National Park).  What he WON\'T believe in, despite the imploring of his fellow deputy (Ronny Cox), is that this car doesn\'t have a driver but rather is possessed by a demonic force.  When it chases a local schoolteacher (Kathleen Lloyd) into a cemetary, it won\'t barge through (it nevertheless succeeds in killing her in her home).  Brolin still doesn\'t believe in it even after the film\'s fiery climax.Though not necessarily blessed with originality, being as it is a combination of THE OMEN and DUEL, THE CAR nevertheless moves with velocity, thanks in large part to an ensemble cast that includes John Marley, R.G. Armstrong (a Peckinpah regular), Roy Jenson, and John Rubinstein.  Director Elliot Silverstein, whose credits include CAT BALLOU and A MAN CALLED HORSE, makes the most of the plot with very good special effects, including the explosive finale; and he is helped by a good score from Leonard Rosenman (Oscar-winner for adapting music for Kubrick\'s BARRY LYNDON in 1975), which incorporates the ominous Gregorian chant \\"Dies Irae.\\"Though not a masterpiece per se, THE CAR is nevertheless far better than some might give it credit for.

Based on a short story by William Faulkner, the play as well as the screenplay were written by Horton Foote, of \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" fame.  Naturally, it\'s set in Mississippi in the days when mules and buggies were used for transportation, and old men still remembered fighting in the Civil War.Robert Duvall is cast in the role of Jackson Fentry, a simple cotton farmer who takes on a job of caretaker at a sawmill during the winter months.  It\'s a lonely place, and he lives in a shack, but there\'s a water pump outside and a wood stove to cook on, and he\'s used to a hard life.  He hears a low moan outside one day, and discovers Sarah Eubanks, played by Olga Bellin, who is weak and pregnant and needing care.  She\'s been abandoned by her husband and has no place to go.  Both of them are quite shy and their meeting, in which he invites her in to his shack, is a small masterpiece of nuance. She has large expressive eyes and they both talk very slowly, but I never felt bored and easily adjusted to the pace.During the next few months their life together becomes idyllic but there is always an underlying tragic feel to their happiness.  \\"Marry me Sarah,\\" he says.  But alas, she can\'t; she\'s already married.  As the story moves on, it gets sadder and sadder and, when, twenty years later, he\'s called to be a juror in a murder trial, we all understand why his vote causes a mistrial.  It\'s a fitting conclusion, although not a happy one.This is perhaps one of Robert Duvall\'s greatest roles; one that he has said in interviews is still his favorite.  It required excellent acting ability and he certainly demonstrated it.  Throughout, we identify completely with the simple farmer with his deep regional southern accent. Olga Bellin is also excellent, but, with the exception of two minor roles on television, this was her only film.  The screenplay is perfect also, using language that was natural to the characters.  And the simple black and white cinematography sets the mood just perfectly.  All together, this is a small gem and not to be missed by those who love good drama.

There is one intense scene of pain during childbirth but nothing explicit. A murder happens on-screen but nothing graphic or closeup.STARRING-Robert Duvall. Screenplay by Horton Foote.THEME-Unconditional love and compassion.STORY-Based on a short story by William Faulkner, the film opens with the brief flashback of a night scene where a young man and woman are apparently trying to elope without her parent\'s knowledge. The family is aroused and the young man is shot and killed by the father. The camera then moves to the courtroom of a small Mississippi town where a murder trial is in its final argument stage. As the defense wraps up its final argument, the camera pans the jury zooming in on Jackson Fentry (Duvall). When he casts the lone vote against acquitting the father resulting in a hung jury, the defense attorney wonders why would this man vote against 11 of his peers, in this his first trial as a lawyer. The rest of the movie tells us why by taking us back 20 years in the life of Fentry. Duvall is at his best in his role of Jackson Fentry, an introverted cotton farmer who leaves his father\'s farm to be the watchman at a rural sawmill about 30 miles from home. We see a tragic and touching love story between Duvall and a young, pregnant woman who has been deserted by her husband. In Duvall you see man\'s capacity for love and to do good. In the end we also experience man\'s capacity for evil and to do harm to his fellow man.

Jury deliberation is shanghaied by one man, Jackson Fentry (Robert Duvall), causing a mistrial. The attorney makes it his business to learn more about Fentry, a story beginning twenty years earlier, declaring, \\"If I knew then what I know now, he would never have sat on this journey.\\" Based on Horton Foote\'s adaptation of a story by William Faulkner, Fentry is a solitary, taciturn man, hardly an anomaly in that period, survival accomplished with a minimum of comfort and much labor. Accepting a job as caretaker of a Tupelo sawmill, Fentry settles into a quiet existence, adapting easily to his circumstances.Preparing to walk to his father\'s farm thirty-one miles away the day before Christmas, Fentry is distracted by moans originating in the sawmill. He discovers a pregnant woman (Olga Bellin), collapsed in exhaustion. Embarrassed by her predicament, the woman wants only to \\"get my strength back\\" before moving on, but Fentry senses her frailty, guiding her into his shack. She is clearly unwell. In an act of instinctive generosity, Fentry offers her shelter until the child is born. What ensues is a delicate, respectful relationship (\\"Yessir\\", \\"No, Ma\'am\\"), a compassionate loner offering protection to a woman abandoned by her husband, cast out after her marriage by her father and three brothers. The emotional nuances between these two characters beautifully balanced, Sarah tentative and trusting, Fentry revealing a depth of character and capacity for love belied by his restricted circumstances. This gentle, frightened woman blossoms under the tender care of the stranger who offers shelter.As the birth draws near, Sarah speaks of her fear of dying, exacting a promise from Fentry that he will raise her child if something happens to her. After the birth, Fentry cradles the infant boy, declaring him \\"my son\\"; Sarah agrees to marry him since her lawful husband is in the wind. Thus pass the happiest days of Fentry\'s life, the boy the center of his existence until circumstances conspire against Fentry, his joy extinguished in one devastating afternoon until the scene in the courtroom twenty years later. Duvall is superb in Faulkner\'s dark drama, his spirit shining through a character with an infinite and previously untapped capacity for love. The dialog is simple, powerful in the hands of Duvall and Bellin, who embrace their brief encounter. Duvall transcends the screen, his monotone bringing to mind Billy Bob Thornton\'s inflections in \\"Sling Blade\\" (perhaps Thornton\'s inspiration?). Vivid against a stark landscape, Duvall creates magic, a touching, evocative film, a lonely man seizing an opportunity seldom encountered in his barren world.

DeRiemer", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "A forbidding mansion far from town, a night of driving rain and thunder, a mute young woman who works for the ill matriarch, a spiral staircase that goes down to the shadowy basement...and a killer who strangles women who are \\"imperfect.\\"The Spiral Staircase may not be full of frights, but it is an eerie exploration of suspense. The mansion itself is a great prop. Lit by candles and gas light, the rooms, covered with flocked wallpaper, are filled with flickering shadows, deep velvet curtains, carved marble fireplaces and dark oaken tables. Helen Capel (Dorothy McGuire), who became mute when she was a child, works there as a maid. She helps care for Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), the bedridden, ill and strong-willed matron of the house. Mrs. Warren has a son, Steve Warren (Gordon Oliver), an unreliable ne\'er-do-well, and a stepson, Professor Albert Warren (George Brent). She has no illusions. \\"They are both weaklings,\\" she says.In the village, young women are being strangled...one had a limp, another was simple minded, one had a scar on her face. It\'s not long before we realize Helen is on the killer\'s list, and that the killer is most likely someone who lives in the Warren mansion. One person who seems drawn to Helen is Dr. Parry (Kent Smith), the new physician in the village. He is convinced that Helen can be made to speak and wants to take her to Boston for treatment. Mrs. Warren, although bedridden and often irascible, is no fool about the murders. When Helen is late coming home in the evening from the village, Mrs. Warren tells her, \\"Come here. I\'d hoped you were never coming back. You should run away. Leave this house tonight if you know what\'s good for you!\\" During the long night, however, the killer shows his determination to make Helen his next victim.It\'s not too hard to figure out who the killer most likely is. Since Dorothy McGuire is the star of the movie, it\'s also unlikely that her character will be killed. What makes this movie work so well, in my opinion, are several elements. First, not whether Helen will be killed, but what dangers will Helen face unable to call for help, including a final confrontation with the killer? Second, who among the supporting cast will be killed? There is the professor\'s secretary, Blanche (Rhonda Fleming), the cook (Elsa Lanchester), her husband (Rhys Williams) and the nurse (Sara Algood). It\'s unlikely all will live. Third, the production values of the movie. The Spiral Staircase is beautifully staged and filmed, with each shot framed for maximum creepy effect. The descent to the basement, where one killing takes place and another is attempted, is almost worth the price of the DVD itself. The place is deeply shadowed with wooden trusses and brick walls, piles of cut wood and an axe, heavy casks and rows of cobwebbed wine bottles...so many places to hide, and the only light coming from candles so easy to blow out. Fourth, the killings are subtly handled, which makes them all the more unsettling. The murderer is never shown until the end. Before then we only see his eyes. We never see the actual killings, either, only black shadow and white hands clutching at the air. And fifth, the performances of Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore. McGuire, in my view, was a fine actress with an innate quality of goodness about her. We worry about Helen because of McGuire\'s skill and personality. Barrymore was a dominant actress in all her roles. Here, bedridden, she must act with her eyes and her face. She becomes an implacable old woman who sees that justice is done.The Anchor Bay DVD has an excellent picture and audio.

Taking  place mostly within the confines of an old house, it is a mystery that builds as we get closer to unmasking the killer. It\'s the sort of film that you might watch on a cold winter\'s evening beside the fireplace. Dorothy McGuire does an exceptional job as lead, playing Helen, a mute servant girl who is danger from a deranged killer who preys on women who have some type of physical handicap.The film opens with a shocking murder of a woman at the movies. The murder, it seems, is the third one in recent days, with each murder having involved women with some type of physical abnormality. Helen, who happened to have gone to the movies on her day off, is told to get home soon before it gets dark. Later, after the constable gives word that the \\"killer is loose and in the vicinity\\", it becomes clear that Helen may be a target and in imminent danger. Suspicion arises within the household as to who the murderer, and next victim, may be.Particularly effective is how the narrative is shown to the viewer. The story alternates from a neutral perspective to a perspective from the killer\'s point of view. The way this is done is reminiscent of some slasher and horror films of the modern era, and this really intensifies and enhances the tension as we get closer to seeing how things will turn out. The film builds to a dramatic, suspenseful conclusion.This film has everything that a suspense set in Gothic tradition should have: shadowy figures, darkness, dramatic tension, creepy music score, a likeable heroine, a murderer lurking around within, ominous warnings from a sickly invalid, slight romantic interests, and a variety of suspects and victims.

What did make \\"The Spiral Staircase\\" rather  innovative was the use of a mute servant girl, played by Dorothy McGuire,  as one of the murderer\'s intended victims. It\'s this element that provides  the film a larger measure of suspense, and creates a mood of vulnerability  comparable to some of the best horror films of the day.There\'s the  strong influence of Val Lewton\'s fright-films of the early 40s, signaled by  the presence of Kent Smith and James Bell ---  \\"leftovers\\" from the Lewton  troupe who had appeared, respectively, in \\"The Cat People\\" and \\"I Walked  With a Zombie.\\" In fact, Lewton\'s use of Bell in \\"The Leopard Man\\" clearly  figured in Robert Siodmak\'s direction for \\"The Spiral Staircase,\\" except  that in this film, Bell becomes a police inspector, and the red herring  role goes to (well, no need to spoil it for newcomers...).Merely  recounting the influences on this film, though, gives no indication of its  real magic, which lies in the way Siodmak brings everything together into a  sort of Gothic gestalt. And we might see McGuire\'s performance as sort of a  visual obverse to that of Claude Rains in \\"The Invisible Man\\": whereas  Rains did almost everything by conveying  \\"omnipotence\\" with his voice,  McGuire steals the show by conjuring helplessness through pantomime and  facial expressions.Thankfully, we now have \\"The Spiral Staircase\\" in  what is probably the best print seen in decades. In fact, Anchor Bay really  deserves accolades for this excellent DVD, which gives us this film in a  beautifully-preserved edition.

The show, however, takes place in the early 1900s in posh London.  It is truly a first class operation, fine acting, beautiful sets, superb period costumes, enthralling storylines, and just plain fun to watch; yes there is a share of humor.The premise of the show is the upperclass extremely wealthy family of four, parents and their two adult children. The adult children make their presence periodically, and the servants have their share of dramatic escapades in the lower part of the mansion.The characters are all memorable, engaging, and quite entertaining to absorb.  What makes this such an addictive series to watch is what you learn about how the wealthy and servants behave, perform,  and communicate.  The episodes take you several places without one getting over exposed by the same sets.  It is a wonderful lesson on historical periods.What\'s good is that you may need to use the subtitles, due to the accents, and just to learn so many new phrases and words that cover interesting topics that one is no familiar with.  The subtitles for Season One are very good, no gaps, and correct titles.Plus, the episodes are fast-paced, nothing drags, content is filled with dialogue.Once you start this, you just keep going into more and more....

This is why Upstairs Downstairs, both the original and the update, Manor House and Gosford Park have been so popular. Viewers can put themselves in the shoes of those both up and down.The new Upstairs Downstairs seeks to update a beloved classic and does a good job. Indeed, my only complaint is that this series was only three episodes long and we didn\'t get enough complexity in the stories. The story begins with aristocratic newlyweds moving into the family mansion on Eaton Place. The house is re-decorated in the moderne style and that and the costumes are worth the price of admission, especially to lovers of deco. The family is rounded out by relatives who come to stay, in this case, the husband\'s overbearing mother and the wife\'s trouble-making sister. German fascists were courting the English aristocracy throughout the thirties and into the forties and the English flirtation with fascism makes an appearance in the person of German Ambassador Ribbentrop and the attendance of the sister and chauffeur at fascist meetings. Jewish refugees come to the household in the form of a university professor turned upstairs maid and her daughter. The class system that will be completely swept away by the end of the war is examined from every perspective. The infamous Mrs. Simpson makes a delightful appearance and English ambivalence to her person and her role is well-played here.All of the elements of a great story are here, but the series is just too short. Episodes need to be longer and stories need to be further developed. Everything felt rushed. Comparison with the superior Downton Abbey are inevitable, but I think this has the potential to be just as good, provided the second season expands on the groundwork laid here.High marks to the costumer and set designer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Update of a Classic", "unixReviewTime": 1325548800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2012"}\n',

Wilson \\"Atheen\\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I\'m sort of glad I started with the fifth season, because while I still enjoy the characters in their first season form, I have a greater appreciation for their incredible development as people over the course of the series.  Having seen the beloved cook Mrs. Bridges in her final form in Season Five, it was positively shocking to see her sell some of the household\'s food for her own personal gain.  I know that it was done at the time--it may well have been expected and accepted by employers--but I could hardly have imagined her doing so!  Had I watched the series from beginning to end as most people do, I would have missed this sense of personal growth and integrity, because I would already have forgotten the passing event by the end of the series.  That would have been sad.In Season One, the viewer is introduced to all the main characters.  Their edges are \\"raw\\" here, because they have yet to undergo the smoothing and sorting process that occurs among members of the same household.  The era is the very early 1900\'s and the costumes, manners and technology produce a sense of ambiance that is almost like being there.  The social inequities of the period are the central focus of this season, probably because it is the aspect of early twentieth century England most likely to come to mind to writers wanting to create a \\"real\\" experience for viewers.  Certainly to anyone steeped in Dickens as most of the contributers probably were, this would be the easiest theme to begin with for a new program.  This would also have been a good point to pick during the turbulant 1970s, when everything about society was (again) being questioned by the young of the time.Most of the season deals with the realities of being a poor person dependent upon a wealthy household for his or her well being.  The steep fall from the safety of a domestic position to destitution is made very clear.  The sacrifice of personal dignity or even physical integrity in order to avoid the crushing poverty of urban England is made abundantly clear by the events in the life of the house maid Sarah, the scullery maid Emily, and the footman Albert.  Much of the action seems to be seen from the perspective of the upper parlor maid, Rose, who throughout the seasons takes a very leading role in events both upstairs and downstairs. By using her as their foil, the writers manage to make the realities of the more unfortunate characters much more realistic.  Rose sees the rise and fall of many individuals in the household and clings tenaciously to the safety of her role in the house.  She is also witness to the frustrations of those above stairs, especially the younger members of the household who have a foot in both the old world of their elders and the new one that is being technologically forced on them.Above stairs, the social mores of the upper class reveal the extent to which they are also hamstrung by expectations and demands.  James Belamy is unable to find satisfaction in his role as heir.  The acceptable careers open to him are limited and framed by expectations.  Elizabeth, his sister, having acheived a level of education and social awareness that is not generally allowed in upper class women, struggles unsuccessfully with the social ills of her time, only to find she is not taken seriously and that she is completely unprepared for the realities of the poor or to make any effective changes in their condition.  She can only give them food and clothing, a bandaid on a situation that obviously requires major surgery!  Lady Marjorie--and indirectly her mother--a woman who has the mind and abilities of a man but who must work politically through her husband leads a pampered but rather boring life, waiting to host influential parties for her husband.  Her husband Richard, is a man of common origins made 1st viscount Bellamy.  His upbringing as a middle class person--son of a minister--puts his values and his actions often at odds, creating a marvelous dramatic dissonance.  His decisions, while noble, are not always realistic or wise given the situations in which he finds himself, making him the very illustration of a man whose good intentions lead so often to disaster or at least unpleasantness.  Married to an aristocrat whose money finances his political career and lifestyle, he is often unable to do what his conscience dictates but must dance to the tune played by his in-laws.What stands out most, especially after viewing the final season, is how the sometimes tragic events of the lives of these people brings them closer and closer together.  Their consideration of and feelings for one another over the course of the 5 seasons is heartwarming.  Even while we realize that the social ills of the time in which the characters lived were unpleasant, we can\'t help but feel it is from this type of caring that individuals survived and improved their world, and it gives us hope for our own.A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.", "unixReviewTime": 1282348800, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2010"}\n',

Meanwhile Hallam\'s mother Maud moves in and there is almost instant friction between Hallam, Lady Agnes and the mother-in-law living in the home.  In addition Lady Agnes\' sister moves in and she is a socialist/fascist want-to-be who causes a lot of problems for Hallam and Agnes.This show contains a lot of drama, tension, personal conflict and it all is brought to the surface perfectly by the excellent cast of the show.  The storyline is well done and the writers have done well writing a story that is interesting and fun to watch.  I find it interesting to watch the British interpretation of historical characters like Mrs. Simpson, the woman who married the King, Herr Ribbentrop a Nazi leader working in England and the new King of England when he takes over after his brother abdicates his rank as King to marry Mrs. Simpson.The servants also play a major role in keeping the house running properly but also bringing in their own personal problems into the house.  This first season sets a lot of ground work for the coming season and the building tensions between Germany and the rest of Europe right before WW II.One character who plays a major role in Season One and Two is Persephone who is the sister of Agnes.  She is the sultry, sexy and troublemaking girl whom you will learn to hate.  Her selfish and one sided nature is overwhelming and evil and you will either love her or hate her.This is an excellent show and my wife and I loved it.

The house has been inherited by Lord Hallam Holland and he moves in with his wife Lady Agnes. Rose Buck, who now runs a small domestic hiring service, staffs the downstairs and becomes housekeeper. The upstairs dramas include a tyrannical and eccentric mother (Eileen Atkins), an out-of-control sister and glimpses into the life of a foreign office diplomat. Downstairs, there are quite as many intrigues, and when the upstairs and downstairs mix, there are the predictable problems.The scenery is lush, each character is cast with care; in particular, Ed Stoppard (son of dramatist Tom Stoppard) is mesmerizing as the stiff-upper-lip husband and diplomat. But every cast member has plenty of lines and a back story, which makes this an engaging series. The second season, on the cusp of World War II, is even better.It\'s a shame that Jean Marsh\'s illness and disagreements about the direction of the scripts (that Eileen Atkins was consulting on, as one of the original developers of Upstairs, Downstairs) ended up with the series cancelled after the second season. The last episode of Season 2 had many threads hanging that could have made a long and satisfying drama series. We\'ll just have to imagine them.

Harris \\"Film aficionado\\"", "helpful": [29, 30], "reviewText": "A staunch supporter of the original \\"Upstairs, Downstairs,\\" I was more than a little intrigued when an updating was announced. A true piece of television history for five seasons of groundbreaking drama, the modernization certainly had a lot to live up to. So I was very surprised that this promised series only had three episodes--and it was actually a sequel of sorts as opposed to a re-imagining. Well, the truth of the matter is--this version definitely lacks the bite and complexity of the original series. But with such a limited running time, I suppose that was to be expected. However, the resultant product (while perhaps not the stuff of TV legend) is a fitfully entertaining confection in its own right. Glossy, well produced, well acted--this version may be slightly superficial, but it sure is likable enough.Set several years after 165 Eaton Place closed it doors, the current series is set in 1936 at the precipice of world conflict. New inhabitants (Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes) move onto the premises and must rebuild the house to its former glory. Hawes enlists the aid of an employment specialist (Jean Marsh reprising the infamous role of Rose, but with a bit less pluck) to staff the quarters. Complicating matters, the indomitable Eileen Atkins (cue expected Emmy nomination) is on hand as the free spirited, but strong willed mother in law. The introductory episode plays largely to comedic conventions as Hawes and Atkins engage in subtle warfare. Each episode gets progressively darker, with the rise of fascism playing as the predominant plot point in the second show. And for the finale, things wrap up pretty conveniently for everyone. This is not meant to be a dark historical treatment--the unpleasant backdrop is really secondary to the antics of the cast. It\'s entertaining soap opera mayhem against the backdrop of history.Again, forty years from now, this won\'t be considered the enduring classic that its predecessor is. But that\'s really not its intent. The cast is fun and engaging--there isn\'t quite the pronounced distinction between Upstairs and Downstairs that helped define the original. Funny and touching, it\'s hard not to be enchanted by this show even with its more fluffy approach. I thought everyone was great--but once again, Atkins takes the prize for most valuable player. Haughty, hysterical, and surprisingly down to earth--she will be what I remember most about this contemporary visit to the legendary 165 Eaton Place. And if you haven\'t seen the original, do so.

This turned out to be a wonderfully done period drama that, instead of choosing to romanticize the era, took it on headlong and approached such topics as the evolving political scene and how it directly affected the lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place with depth, while still being tactful. In other words, the story did not deflate from the inclusion of such a sensitive topic, rather, gave the series a more believable dimension.Another thing I was impressed by was how there was not a single extraneous character, how all the different story lines came together so artfully. In particular, Adrian Scarborough\'s portrayal of Warwick Pritchard, the Butler, was absolutely delightful - he stole every scene he was in and I found myself disappointed that Pritchard didn\'t have more time on screen. If I wasn\'t hopelessly enamoured with Upstairs/Downstairs already, his stepping in to deliver Lady Agnes\' baby would have sealed the deal for me.I will say that this did suffer a bit from the time constraints. Three hour long episodes were not really enough, and there were instances where elements of the plot felt rushed - even a little choppy - although that could very well be from PBS\' habit of cutting out several minutes worth of often pivotal scenes when UK programs air on Masterpiece. Overall, however, despite my complaints about the length, it was inspiring, enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in British drama.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Instant Favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1303862400, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2011"}\n',

Five series were produced in total (on five boxed sets), and the entire series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, the Roaring 20s, and finally concluding with 1929`s stock market crash).The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery.  The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents).  I don\'t wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away.  Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household.  First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord.  Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges.  Other memorable characters to whom we are introduced in the first series include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily; and Lady Margery\'s prim and snobbish lady\'s maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer.  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs \\"family\\" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.The first through fourth boxed sets cover series one through four respectively, and each set contains thirteen 50-minute episodes on seven tapes.  The final boxed set (series five) contains sixteen 50-minute episodes on eight tapes.Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward\'s death in 1910.  There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite.  Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI.  Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed.  Series five covers the twenties.In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama.  But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \\"goings on,\\" scandal, and so forth, you\'ll enjoy it all the more!  I usually recommend buying the first boxed set and then, if you like it, buying the rest.  This is one series about which I have no hesitation in recommending that you go ahead and purchase the lot; you won\'t regret it--it\'s simply THAT good!  And those who\'ve enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs, will surely enjoy The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).

He got so wild when Jane \\"bewitched\\" his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife\'s place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don\'t think was the intended effect. She\'d never like a guy like that, and he\'d...well. I just wasn\'t seeing it. At first.So why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It\'s not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I\'ve seen so far.It spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie\'s stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, \\"or do I see them there now?\\" Problem is, she doesn\'t look at all like she\'s upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester\'s assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.Although, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.Bottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don\'t need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five.

Dalton\'s performance as Mr Rochester is superb and flawless but he is far too handsome for my liking. Clarke is just satisfactory - her Jane is too weak and bland. With respect to the Hurt and Gainsbourgh rendition, I was unfortunately quite bored after Anna Paquin departed from the screen. However, this was mainly attributed to improper screenplay and direction and  the lack of chemistry between the two lead characters.After seeing Ciaran Hinds\' brilliant performance in `Ivanhoe\' and `Persuasion\', I had to watch this version. However, I was quite disppointed as he portrays a rather savage, arrogant and simple Mr Rochester and fails to depict the absolute complexity and glamour of Bronte\'s character as others have mentioned in their reviews. For this I solely blame the directors though, for Hinds\' undoubtedly has the capacity to provoke the audience in the same manner that Bronte\'s Mr Rochester does the reader ( - evidence from his numerous awesome performances clearly suggest so).Samantha Morton is undeniably my favourite Jane though. She is far more vivacious and yet more solemn than Zelah Clarke and exudes much more passion than Charlotte Gainsbourgh (but for that I also blame misguided direction &amp; screenplay engineered by Zeffirelly &amp; Whitemore). Morton is perfect for the part and Hinds would be to if only proper direction was given and pivotal dialogue was included. Nevertheless, apart from these failures I still enjoyed this film.Thus, if you want to see a good film, I definitely recommend this, but if you want to watch a totally true adaptation of Bronte\'s novel then it is better to see the Dalton and Clarke rendition.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but had its flaws", "unixReviewTime": 998438400, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2001"}\n',

Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it\'s one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds\' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds\' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn\'t watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn\'t Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part..There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I\'ve seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds\' and Morton\'s recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds\' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds\' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn\'t hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I\'ll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it\'s Hinds and Morton hands down.  I would have given this movie 4 stars if based totally on the story, but I\'ve given this version 5 stars based on the rich acting of both the lead actors (especially Hinds), they are wonderful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ciaran Hinds the perfect Rochester", "unixReviewTime": 1331164800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2012"}\n',

Her &quot;Tess&quot; is breathtakingly beautiful without being at all self-conscious of her looks, and is genuinely charming and adoring. Whenever Tess cries (and she does that A LOT due to her tragic circumstances), it\'s impossible not to be affected or to reach quickly for the box of Kleenex.This is a sad and compelling story set in the later part of the 19th century, about a simple country girl named Tess who is the oldest child in a poor family with many children. Due to her family\'s poverty, she is forced, at 16, to find work (i.e. taking care of the fowl farm) at the great House of a family called the D\'Urbervilles (whom Tess and her family are led to believe are their distant relations). Naive Tess (who then knows nothing about the &quot;dangers&quot; of men), is quickly courted and seduced by the young lord of the House, Alec (who has set his sights on her since the first day they meet), although she doesn\'t love him. In her distress, she later packs up and leaves the House to return home; both Tess and Alec not realizing that she is already carrying his child. The child is born but later dies of illness. Tess leaves home a second time and finds work as a dairymaid in a distant place where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare, the handsome and well-respected son of a clergyman. Angel, who is unaware of Tess\'s &quot;past&quot;, falls in love with her and holds her in awe for her virtue, beauty, grace and goodness of heart. Tess tries to tell him of her past, but each time, fate cruelly intervenes and she never gets her chance... until it is too late. On their wedding night, Angel confesses to Tess that he has been promiscuous in the past and begs for her forgiveness. Tess readily forgives him and with this opening provided by Angel, she proceeds to tell him of her past relations with Alec and the resultant child, truly believing that Angel will forgive her as he himself has been forgiven for his own past sin. But this is not to be.... and great tragedy (Hardy-style) ensues.I loved the novel, and find this adaptation to be one of the most supreme of period dramas ever produced. The casting, acting, directing, cinematography and screenplay are simply perfect.I particularly enjoyed the scenes where Alec is teasing and courting Tess e.g. the very picturesque and charming moment at the strawberry garden. It is also endearing and funny to watch Alec teaching Tess how to whistle (&quot;whistling&quot; being necessary as his mother, the eccentric matriach of the House, insists that Tess whistles to her caged birds every morning as part of her duties). Another funny and delightful scene is when Alec asks Tess for a good-bye kiss after failing to persuade her to stay on at the House. She immediately offers him her cheek (for the kiss), glares angrily at him and says: &quot;See how well you have mastered me!&quot;Inevitably, there are slight deviations from the novel e.g. Tess\'s sister, Liza-Lu does not appear in the last scene (as in the book). Also, Alec\'s character is portrayed in a better light in the movie i.e. he frequently shows his sincerity in loving Tess and persistently offering to take care of her. He has many faults.... but he does love her and has never abandoned her once he finds out about her destitute situation. Can\'t say the same for Angel\'s character, though. He can\'t accept Tess because he deems Alec to be her &quot;husband by nature&quot; and not himself. Angel may also be suffering from broken dreams and a broken heart, but with his hypocrisy and evident cruelty, he hurts and crushes Tess more than Alec ever does.This series (4-hour long) is a masterpiece one can watch over and over again, despite its tragic storyline. I love the theme song which is a beautiful melody that stayed in my head for days!

We never read the book for that class, but I read it soon after, and I believe this adaptation is mostly faithful.!!SPOILERS!!Tess is my favorite Hardy novel next to The Return of the Native. Justine Waddell\'s performance is excellent, as she truly embodied \\"innocence\\" transformed into a suicidal, cold woman, no longer caring about her future because of the men who betrayed and ruined her.I hated Alec, naturally, but I hated Angel even more in some ways.  What a hypocrite, telling Tess that he couldn\'t love her, didn\'t want to see her anymore because he was only in love with her purity, and she wasn\'t really pure. Never mind that the rape wasn\'t her fault - \\"You were more sinned against\\" he admitted, though he still wouldn\'t accept her.And I definitely considered it rape, not consensual sex/seduction (Tess admitting that she had some \\"feelings\\" for Alec didn\'t make it consensual). Makes me sick, especially since he wasn\'t pure either. The wretched double standard rears its ugly head yet again.  Anyway, I\'m inclined to believe that Angel would have rejected her even if it had been a totally brutal rape with no feelings/attraction involved.  She was damaged goods in Angel\'s eyes, and it\'s tragic that this sort of thing still goes on today.I always enjoy the atmosphere at the end of the movie...the colors, the mood. Tess seems a bit psychotic, complete with the glazed eyes, wandering around in her nightgown repeating, \\"It\'s too late.\\"  And a bit later, having changed into a gorgeous dark blue dress, she walks quickly through a quiet, wealthy town by the sea - Sandbourne.  With sounds of seagulls, so tranquil despite the characters\' turmoil.By the final scene, I hate Angel more than ever. He could have prevented so much if he\'d loved her completely, as a husband should. She had no other choice but allow Alec to take over the role of supportive husband, to deliver her family from poverty.And so it appears that there are two villains to this story.

This series is an adaptation of C.S. Forrester\'s Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, which is chronologically speaking the first of a series of books following Hornblower\'s career. (Forrester actually wrote several books which come later in the series before taking up Hornblower\'s midshipman years, but that doesn\'t really matter to today\'s readers and watchers). The four episodes included in this series are beautifully done, and you really understand what life was like above and below decks.  The soaring, spirited music further enhances the series.  England and France are locked in combat, and Hornblower, a 17 year old midshipman, finds himself on the front lines.  He visibly matures from a callow lad who gets sea sick when the ship is in harbor to a determined and ingenious leader.  He is admired by virtually everybody on board, from his fellow midshipmen to the captains to the crew to the varied group of civilians who sometimes ride along as passengers.  He faces down an angry rival, captures and is captured byFrench and Spanish enemies, and even abandons ship and escapes from prison with dash and derring do.

To watch these episodes is almost like reading the Forester novels themselves.  The best part of this series is that it gets you to feel the life of a seaman of that time.  The sounds of the ship, the bells, whistles, drum beats, etc. all merge together and bring you back into another time.  While I always felt that the Hornblower books give a somewhat romanitzed view of Royal Navy life during the Napoleanic Wars, there can be no doubt that this TV series truly does justice to the books.  More productions should be made like this.  Hornblower\'s exploits while impressive, are believeable.  There is none of that annoying tongue and cheek element that we find in many of these period productions.  The \\"Sharpe Series\\" was largely ruined because of that.  Here there has been a  conscious effort to stay within the spirit of the books.The best episodes in my opinion are 1 and 4.  The middle ones are a bit slow and tedious a times, but they all provide wonderful character development.  The fourth episode is a real treat for those interested in having a look at combined naval and land operations of the period.  The British were the only ones that could do this sort of thing, and the coordination involved was very difficult. The viewer is treated to some interesting land combat scenes, which are nicely done.  Much attention has been paid to uniforms, drill and eqippment, which all get high marks.  John Mollo was the costume specialist, so its not surprsing that the uniforms are accurate to the buttons!  He did many fine military uniform books in years past.Perhaps what makes this series so good is that there has been no silly romance put in to distract the viewer.

Little is the kind of woman that women find hard to like: delicately beautiful, exceptionally talented - making her perfect to play Becky.  It is the subtle nuances in her moments that give her performance great depth and complexity - needed for accessibility for a selfish character who is the smartest person in any room she is in.  Becky is a woman who would agree with the quote of another brilliant beauty, Hedy Lamar: \\"Any woman can be glamourous.  All she has to do is stand still and look stupid.\\" Little\'s Beky  is not as likable or vulnerable as Reese Witherspoon - who played Becky in a major motion picture film version made right around the same time - but with a miniseries we have time to understand her more.  Besides, not many actresses are as likable as Witherspoon.As the story begins, this production does not look lavish, but the casting is so wonderful, the script so strong, the costumes simple but just right, that we are given the ability to focus on getting to know the people we will be following through 6 episodes.It is this initial simplicity that is the brilliance of the production design by Malcolm Thornton.  In the early stages, poverty is cramped and messy; work is dark, cluttered and rotting, and wealth is clean, and bright and airy... like freedom.  As we progress throught the story, wealth becomes more complex, overstuffed and overdecorated, echoing the complexity of the lives of Becky and Rawdon.  Rawdon played by the handsome and overwhelmingly talented Nathaniel Parker (INSPECTOR LINLEY, BLEAK HOUSE).Breathtaking Andrew Davies, possibly the most brilliant adapter of the classics of all time, gifts us with a screenplay of grace and subtlety, weaving the ease of modern speech perfectly into the period action in a way that feels classic, but is totally accessible.It all bounces along to the ohm-pa-pa of a brass band.  This band is one of the anachronistic touches of the production.  While it passes as a military band, it also has a the raw, slightly under-rehearsed sound of a New Orleans jazz band, and sometimes a 1940s dancehall... meanwhile Becky\'s musical choices are straight from the pub... to the delight of the men around her.  The band is really the only downfall of the production, in the moments of great serious importance, the band hits us over the head with a blaringly repetitive theme that gets very annoying after 6 episodes.  It is the only \\"wrong note\\" in an otherwise witty and wise score.  One of the nice subtle touches is that even Becky\'s singing, which at first seems flawless and delightful, begins to sound a bit flat in the episodes where we see dark results of her behavior on those around her.The music for Amelia and William is completely different.  Plaintive melodies played as quietly as loyalty and love that things only of the good of the beloved.  Philip Glenister as William carries the heart of the piece with affecting restraint.  Miriam Margoles does her best work EVER here, and Jeremy Swift as Jos is absolutely delightful in every moment he is on screen!This entire miniseries is just marvelous, aspects of the production in tune with each other, in service to the whole piece.

Austen may deal out the occasional pin-prick, but her social comedy remains well-mannered and has a basic sweetness. Thackeray provides a far more brutal kind of satire; \\"Vanity Fair\\", though nearly 200 years old, is a startlingly modern novel still. Rarely can a reader have been so hard put to find a single sympathetic character in a book. George Osborne is a heartless, vain opportunist; Jos Sedley a ridiculous coward; Amelia Sedley an insipid dreamer forever betting on the wrong horse; Dobbin on the other hand is just too good to be true and infuriatingly servile - et cetera. Only amidst such a cast are we tempted to feel a modicum of sympathy for viciously predatory Becky Sharp, who by modern standards would no doubt qualify as a psychopath. The tables only turn on her when she meets her equal in the vile lord Stayne (what\'s in a name), who warns her: \\"Don\'t overplay your hand, Mrs. Crawley - you\'re in very deep now...\\". She does overplay her hand, and her astonishing social climb is mercilessly reversed. It\'s all very Darwinian avant-la-lettre: survival of the fittest.Andrew Davies perfectly caught on to this in his gritty, highly original adaptation of Vanity Fair for TV. Apart from Becky Sharp (Natasha Little) the cast includes no pleasant beauties of either sex to please the eye. Murkiness and squalor are not eschewed and find their peak at Queen\'s Crawley, where maggots indeed crawl on Lady Crawley\'s dinner plate, and Sir Pitt senior devours his tripe with relish. Though not all viewers may be pleased, the fact is that the conditions shown in this series are far more realistic depictions of actual living conditions in late 18th and early 19th century England than the glossed-over prettiness presented in most Austen-films. And still many of the actors have much better teeth than they would have had in those days...The acting is quite excellent throughout, and the intensity of it is heightened by frequent use of close-ups. At other times camera movements are deliberately unsteady, lending a documentary feel to Amelia\'s visit of George\'s grave, and making the viewer share in the drunkenness when Osborne senior waxes sentimental over young George at his dinner table. In dialog, the camera may well very slowly pan across the room, taking in all the little trinkets and ornaments it meets underway before finally arriving at the face of the other character. Instead of the perfectly choreographed quadrilles of Pride and Prejudice, you may find a dance at a ball depicted by a mere quick succession of close-ups of feet and whirling skirts. It is all rather unconventional and extremely effective. So is the music - the score is dominated by several deliciously raucous wind-band themes that tell us we are, indeed, in a fairground.The DVD comes without any extra\'s. I\'m unsure to judge the picture quality, as I am playing the disc to a PAL TV and don\'t know if this causes distortions. Still it looked more than acceptable, except that pale faces tended to go slightly blue in outdoor scenes, and that dark images looked a bit as if filmed through a slightly sooty lens, and sometimes had unsteady backgrounds.Though in the final reckoning this series may not quite aspire to the perfection of the latest BBC Pride & Prejudice, it is at least as worthwhile and involving to watch, and makes a very refreshing change from the usual period drama routines.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gritty, highly original and compelling adaptation", "unixReviewTime": 1098576000, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2004"}\n',

As it is, this six-hour BBC film version  emits certain items (Jos Sedley\'s ultimate fate, the James Crawley  episode), but is remarkably faithful to its source.  Indeed, a television  mini-series is the best way to adapt such a work, allowing the story to  unfold and the viewer to become involved with the various  characters.This production is fantastic, with beautiful costumes,  excellent performances, and a fine script.

The rest of the cast is well-chosen and all play their parts with  conviction.The greatest hurdle a filmed version of &quot;Vanity  Fair&quot; faces is how to convey the many shifts of tone which Thackeray  goes through in the novel.

While reading Thackeray\'s novel, I\'ve also been able to watch the six part BBC serialization starring Natasha Little as Becky Sharp. I\'ll comment on this BBC serial later--but first to the novel itself.Well, it\'s a very good novel. Certainly one of the best from the Victorian period which it parodies so beautifully. Becky Sharp is a fine literary creation and the personal embodiment of that \\"Vanity Fair\\" which Thackeray, on the one hand, appears to despise so much, while winking at us in happy glee and suggesting \\"it ain\'t such a bad place after all\\" (by gad!)on the other. All the main characters are fully realized and mercilessly exposed in their weaknesses by the unrelenting author.Becky, as I have said, is the very embodiment of the superficial, and finally worthless, attractions on offer in the pitiless and unrelenting world of \\"Vanity Fair\\" which raises people up for a moment, only to mercilessly crush them forever after they have strutted for their little pompous moment on the high society stage. Amelia\'s Major Dobbin is the only really honourable character in the book--and he is continually trampled over by all the bright young things who want to make their momentary splash in \\"Vanity Fair\\". Thackeray describes him as a \\"spooney\\" and, indeed, he spends most of the novel as Amelia\'s platonic lover who dare not ask for more than the little she will give him. Becky Sharp is the real hero, heroine or \\"anti-heroine\\" of this novel \\"without a hero\\". She manipulates everyone with the most perfect judgement and lives for the joy of Vanity Fair\'s thousand intrigues. Her husband Rawdon\'s unexpected escape from a debtor\'s house and subsequent discovery of his wife making love to the Marquis of Steyne (and his resultant thrashing of that gentleman) is probably the most dramatic moment in the book. However, Becky--if not her husband or the Marquis--is able to move beyond even this catastrophe.\\"Vanity Fair\\" is not without faults for the modern reader. Sometimes Thackeray indulges in page after page of almost nonsensical parody of the contemporary society of his day and this comes across (in the 21st century) as even worse than Swift\'s most obscure rants in Gulliver\'s Travels on the Tory/Whig politics of his time. Thankfully, Thackeray doesn\'t usually detain his reader long in such tedious environs, but soon gets his marvellously readable story moving again.As I wrote earlier, I have been watching the 1998 BBC adaptation of \\"Vanity Fair\\" while actually reading the novel itself--and it\'s been quite a revealing experience. Of course, one sympathises with the person responsible for making the adaptation. How is it possible to condense the action of more than 800 pages into a 6 hour serial? No doubt it\'s an impossible task, but I was, mostly, impressed with the beeb\'s minor success. The adaptation is well done, though it\'s not without blemish and, most notably, substitutes some of Thackeray\'s prejudices for several of our own time. For example,(in the novel) Becky\'s husband, Rawdon, thrashes Lord Steyne with his open hand to make the point that he regards him as a coward and expects to be satisfied in a duel. The beeb substituted a drunken head-butt for this subtle assault--presumably because they thought this was more acceptable to late 20th century British yob culture. Again, the serialization accurately includes a black manservant in the Sedley family. However, he (the black manservant) is given a far larger part in the adaptation than in Thackeray\'s novel (where, indeed, he is hardly more than a wretched slave). Wouldn\'t it have been better to simply cut this character out altogether rather than have him purposelessly wandering through (seemingly) every episode full of a somewhat threatening \\"joie de vivre\\"? Nevertheless, as I wrote earlier, the adaptation is probably ALMOST as good as it could have been in the circumstances.

The narrator does a fine job, though she\'s no Carl Sagan.  I had enjoyed it about as much as \\"The Astronomers\\" with Richard Chamberlain because, like that other series, you see first hand what the scientists have studied and discovered.  The visuals add much realism to what they are explaining, something which the  viewer will appreciate.  Many of those techniques, unfortunately, were not available when Sagan made his \\"Cosmos\\" series.  But Sagan, who was a much more lively teacher than any of the other astronomers on \\"The Planets\\", appears only briefly in a couple of clips made years before the series was made.  And when the other scientists appear so often you sometimes wish that they would talk less about and show us more of the celestial wonders that they marvel at.  Still, if can you look behind them, there is much to impress you on the screen.I haven\'t seen the original BBC version, although that would require a different DVD player.  It looks like the BBC tailored this version for American viewers, which is understandable since they wanted sell the series to A & E, an American cable network.  However, as is true of more recent documentaries such as \\"Planet Earth\\" (the BBC version), the documentaries seem better because they aren\'t restricted to the format of the U.S. cable industry. The BBC\'s audience in Britain may be quite different in its tastes than those who watch the cable networks here in America.  So perhaps to our disadvantage, there is less in the American edition about astronomy in other other parts of the world such as Russia and even Great Britain.

It is a portrait of his company. And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn\'t always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful (&quot;my inspiration comes from fear&quot;), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, &quot;My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show.&quot; As one former company member put it when describing Taylor\'s origins: &quot;There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies.&quot;The director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic &quot;Esplanade&quot; that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from &quot;Aureole.&quot; For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work. The music continues seamlessly as the visuals switch from one point in time to another, suggesting without preaching, that dances have a life of their own...and a good one has a chance of outlasting any of its interpreters. Diamond\'s other dance films include &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; (also Paul Taylor\'s company) and &quot;A Balanchine Celebration,&quot; fine and important films in their own right, though not equal to this masterpiece.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Warts, bunions, and all", "unixReviewTime": 972777600, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2000"}\n',

Lizzi", "helpful": [22, 22], "reviewText": "This is a documentary DVD that shows every aspect of the creative forces involved in producing what I believe to be the most captivating of art forms.  \\"Dancemaker\\" is long on intimacy, giving equal time to the minds, the hearts, the souls and the bodies which collaborate to produce great modern dance.  The genius of Paul Taylor and Director Matthew Diamond combine to make an extraordinary documentary.The first thing which struck me was the spontaneity with which Mr. Taylor was shown creating one of his new works.  Standing side-by-side with one of his dancers, the two just ... moved ... and then conjectured about what might go next:  \\"you could start this way ... and then, maybe ...\\"  Very interesting.  While there is a generous offering of studio footage, the recurring stereotype of the intensely driven dancemaster imploring his subjects to understand the gravity of his holy creation (you\'ve seen this in movies) does not exist in this film.  No cinematic exaggeration here:  it\'s just the truest depiction of what happens as dance is created.  In reality, the emotion and interaction between Mr. Taylor and his dancers is often more characteristic of a family than of a teacher/student relationship.Aside from following people around, Mr. Diamond\'s camera gets to many places I\'ve never seen before.  I loved the views from the wings in the opening sequence (\\"Esplanade\\"), and also during the performance in India when the sound system went dead and the crew was trying not to be frantic during the silence (the dancers continued on without missing a step until the sound was restored!).  I also got a kick out of the dancer in his hotel room explaining what he had to go through to wake up after a night of performing.The film highlights two dance pieces, \\"Aureole\\" and \\"Piazzolla Caldera,\\" and even though they aren\'t seen in their entirety, there is no diminishment in their strength and beauty.  Mr. Diamond, who has also directed episodes of PBS\'s \\"Great Performances,\\" was adept at interspersing the contrasting performance film (color) with studio footage (black and white) so that the two meshed perfectly.  The editing during the dance numbers was the best I\'ve ever seen, incorporating both the more typical audience vantage point with the more dramatic on-stage perspective from amongst the dancers.  The proximity and the viewing angles were stunning; a wonderful surprise.  There\'s also a fair amount of footage from the Paul Taylor Dance Archives, showing a younger Mr. Taylor and company performing signature works.In maintaining the foundation of a storyline, the film incorporates a biographical aspect, showing the evolution of Mr. Taylor\'s role as a dancemaker as an outgrowth of his boyhood years.  The interviews with his long-time friends and associates, as well as the words of Mr. Taylor himself, are proof of the depth and seriousness with which he reveres his art.  The film also touches on the troubling business realities that weigh on dance companies:  having to remain financially solvent, and dealing with the picket lines which materialized in New York after the company hired non-union musicians.  There\'s even a scene involving the firing of one of his dancers (\\"I just didn\'t want to work with her\\"), a somber sequence of dialogues, but one which lends strength to the reality of this film.As far as DVD features go, nothing extraordinary, but lots to read about the \\"inspirations and interpretations\\" behind the dances, biographies of selected dancers, and a scrolling list of the company\'s complete repertory (through 1999).Overall, this film\'s portrayal of the ways in which modern dance is created and portrayed make this a DVD I\'d recommend to anyone.

One is impressed with Mr. Taylor\'s creative talent, and the dedication and hard work displayed by his dancers. When completed, the work turns out to be intricate and exciting, and it won over the New York City audience at its premier.

It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America\'s victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.

In \'The Crossing\' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn\'t. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.\'The Crossing\' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch&eacute;, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington\'s friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.The film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice.

They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain &quot;toughness.&quot;  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.If you are interested get Howard Fast\'s &quot;The Unvanguished.&quot;  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast\'s earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington\'s relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .The acting is good to very good.

The film brings to the screen George Washington\'s first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:We get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry\'s owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral\'s sword sent to Congress).There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals \\"alive,\\" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden \\"under the carpet.\\"As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of \\"patriotism.\\"The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.As for the end where it states that: \\"The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.\\"  That should be \\"...to fight the rebel colonists,\\" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.In short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.Strongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\\"In the end, sir, we all kill for profit\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1153353600, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2006"}\n',

What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington\'s troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.This film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington\'s command is well done. The state of mind of Washington\'s troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.In all, I found this one of the best films about Washington\'s attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.

Set II  starts off well with a sci-fi &quot;Build a Better Mousetrap,&quot;  pre-echoing many plots to follow. &quot;The Outside-in Man&quot; has a good  twist ending and a &quot;Man from UNCLE&quot; place to meet the Top Man.  &quot;The Charmers&quot; is the best so far, humorous, having a good plot  and the wonderful Warren Mitchell who would twice play the same bumbling  Russian agent in the Rigg episodes; and in fact it was remade as &quot;The  Correct Way to Kill&quot; with several interesting changes.  &quot;Concerto&quot; has the soon-to-be overdone plot of someone trying to  ruin East-West relations. &quot;Esprit de Corps&quot; also has a  predictable plot but given some broad humor by funny man Roy Kinnear, who  plays his scenes with Steed quite well. &quot;Lobster Quadrille&quot; ends  the series on a not very glorious note; but it does finish with Cathy going  off on vacation, refusing to take on an assignment there, and Steed phoning  a female replacement. I believe they knew by that time that Blackman was  leaving the series.Please watch these without the foresight of what  is to come and try to keep a 1964 frame of mind when this was the hottest  stuff on the telly and a female character never had it so good before Cathy  Gale blew into town.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Historic and most entertaining", "unixReviewTime": 953510400, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2000"}\n',

I thought some parts excellent, some cheesy - but good cheese. Grant himself I thought excellent as the Pimpernel. He plays the witty fop perfectly - not lazily, but one who travels, and seeks new things to be witty about. When the serious things begin, he sobers up, and you get to see the real Pimpernel. Grant rarely lets the drama of the situation weigh him down, consistently has fun with his role. Though not emphasized, his sword-play is quite passable, too.Elisabeth McGovern as Marguerite is the questionable one here. At some points, you think she is perfect for the role; at others, you wonder how they chose her to play the part. Her British accent is passable when she remembers it; and - my biggest gripe - I did not think her pretty enough for the role. She is an attractive actress, yes, but not the knockout Marguerite was supposed to be - The Most Beautiful Woman in France? I think not. Her acting is on the whole good, however, as is her stage presence, so much can and is overlooked.My biggest surprise was Martin Shaw as Chauvelin. Shaw took the role and made more of it than either Raymond Massey or Ian McKellen, combining the past lover with man striving to be in constant control of the situation. His gift for sarcasm, whether natural or invented for this role, is put to good use here. He actually seems almost human at times, trying to serve himself, and France (yes, I did get that feeling). By contrast, McKellen\'s Chauvelin cannot get his mind off Marguerite, and Massey\'s (excellent) portrayal seems one dimensional (not his fault). Martin Shaw was one of the strongest points of this production.The supporting cast was equally good. Emilia Fox (I think that\'s the right spelling) portrays an excellent bad girl in Episode I, While the bad guy of Episode III is superb - almost stole the show from Grant. EPisode II features another excellent bad girl who meets a surprising end. Sets and costuming are what befit a BBC production, and the camera work is excellent: frequent use of distance and panorama make it seem something other than a TV movie. Storyline and plot - it makes sense taken by itself, and provides a good, exciting romp through the world of Revolutionary France. Not close to the book, but it doesn\'t need to be close to the book to be effective. If you\'re an Orczy purist, don\'t bother with it. If, like me, you\'re looking for good period drama with a flair for action and comedy, this is excellent. And well-worth seeing, and re-seeing.

First there is the jaw-dropping, almost hallucinogenic experiance of seeing WWII events in technicolor.  It reminds one of how much black-and-white film aestheticizes and abstracts events.  Admittedly our eyes don\'t see in technicolor either, but the color makes you feel far more psychologically &quot;there&quot; so to speak.  The second thing is the amazing quality of most of this footage.  It hardly seems to have aged at all in 55-60 years!  When you consider that film from the 1960\'s sometimes looks atrociously degraded and washed out, the almost pristine look of this footage is remarkable to say the least.  It must have been stored well and never projected.  (Of course, the producers could choose the best-looking bits from what was reputedly hundreds of hours of rediscovered film.)  Watching this film is a tremendously emotional experiance, sometimes frightening, sometimes grueling, sometimes stomach-turning.  The voice-over narration makes heavy use of contemporary letters and diaries of soldiers and civilians, and is often touching.  The cumulative impact of all this----the island fighting, Nazi rallies, shipyard workers, civilians hanged by Nazis, radiation victims, Pearl Harbor wreckage, air war footage, death camps, and on and on----is almost overwhelming.  Like having your nose shoved into the sheer mess and folly of mass war.Now that I hear that the UK version of this documentary was narrated by the redoubtable John Thaw I\'d love to see THAT version, but otherwise I unreservedly recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Too many people think of documentaries as boring but this demonstrates how mesmerizing they can be.

The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.

Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion.

The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop \\"the bomb\\" on Japan.In addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler\'s German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It\'s truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more.

This wonderful series has become a British institution and a worldwide favorite among viewers.  It has a huge fan following.The story follows the lives and loves of the Bellamy family who reside in a fashionable house in Eaton Place.  Downstairs, their loyal and lively servants uphold their own code of values whilst trying to come to terms with an ever-changing world.  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS covers the years 1903-1930, and features fantastic writing and direction, not to mention top-drawer performances from a gloriously talented cast.Season 1 - We are introduced to the Bellamy family:  Richard (David Langton), his wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their grown-up children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  In the first episode, &quot;On Trial&quot;, we also meet the vivacious Clemence (Pauline Collins) who arrives at 165 Eaton Place looking for a job.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she\'s quickly inducted into the household, but finds life as a servant frustrating and unnatural.Later choice moments in the season include &quot;Magic Casements&quot;, where Lady Marjorie has a brief and tender affair with a young army captain; &quot;The Path of Duty&quot; features the rebellious Elizabeth running away from home on the eve of her society debut; &quot;Why is Her Door Locked?&quot; recounts the unhappy, emotionally-disturbed Mrs Bridges (Angela Baddeley) kidnapping a small child.  The season ends on a hopeful note as Elizabeth marries the romantic poet Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in &quot;For Love of Love&quot;.Season 2 - Picks up the story following Elizabeth and Lawrence\'s honeymoon, and their household in Greenwich.  Humorous scenes downstairs featuring Rose (Jean Marsh), Thomas (John Alderton) and Mrs Fellowes (Dorothy Frere) contrast dramatically with the unhappy marriage of Elizabeth and Lawrence upstairs.Other standout episodes include &quot;Your Obediant Servant&quot;, where Hudson (Gordon Jackson) dresses up as a toff in order to impress his brother\'s family who are visiting from India; &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; where Sarah and Thomas attempt to help Lady Marjorie who\'s being blackmailed about her secret affair from Season 1; and &quot;Out of the Everywhere&quot; where the resourceful Sarah once again saves the day for the Bellamy\'s.  Perhaps the season is best-remembered for &quot;Guest of Honour&quot; in which King Edward comes to dine at 165.  This season marked the last for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah.Season 3 - Another strong season, which gets off to a cracking start in &quot;Miss Forrest&quot;, in which Richard has hired the services of secretary Hazel Forrest (Meg Wynn Owen) while he is busy writing Lord Southwold\'s political biography.  Lady Marjorie is getting ready for a voyage on the Titanic...Later standouts include &quot;A Perfect Stranger&quot; where Rose gets her first taste of real love when she meets charming Gregory Wilmot (Keith Barron), an Australian sheep-farmer. Romance also keeps up James who impetuously proposes to and marries the mild-mannered Hazel;  &quot;Goodwill to all Men&quot; introduces us to Lord Southwold\'s young ward Georgina Worsley (Lesley-Anne Down), and a charming storyline featuring the second (and last) appearance of Cathleen Nesbitt as Dowager Lady Southwold.  The season ends on a dramatic note when World War One is declared.Season 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with &quot;A Patriotic Offering&quot; where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  &quot;The Beastly Hun&quot; features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst &quot;If You Were the Only Girl in the World&quot; has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England.Season 5 - James and Georgina settle into a party lifestyle with their mindless society friends, whilst the newly-married Richard and Virginia settle into life at Eaton Place with her two young children Alice (Anne Yarker) and William (Jonathan Seely).  &quot;A Place in the World&quot; details bored and dissatisfied James following his father in politics; &quot;Disillusion&quot; follows an ill-fated romance between Hudson and young maid Lily (Karen Dotrice), and Georgina toys with a career as a movie actress in &quot;Alberto&quot;.  The season ends with the marriage of Georgina and Robert, the Marquis of Stockbridge (Anthony Andrews).  James returns from a trip to America with big dreams about the Stock Exchange, but then the Wall Street crash puts the financial future of  the Bellamy\'s in doubt...There aren\'t enough words to express how much I love UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.  My favorite moments from the series come mostly from seasons 1 and 2, and while I love the entire series, I particularly love the performances of Nicola Pagett (Elizabeth) and Pauline Collins (Sarah).If you are a fan of the series or a fan of British period drama, then I highly-recommend this superb series!

Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a \'hope it\'s good\' purchase.Finally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.Okay, the \\"cheap\\" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year\'s disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!But the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.  As such Upstairs Downstairs is highly recommended.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Know I Know What All The Fuss Was About", "unixReviewTime": 1359590400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2013"}\n',

Hornaday", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!This British series is truly in a \\"class\\" by itself. It\'s characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family \\"Upstairs\\" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants \\"Downstairs,\\" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life\'s ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.The \\"master\\" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.We come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn\'t address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie\'s life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.The Bellamy\'s house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a \\"person\\" as if she had actually been alive.Other tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy\'s cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy\'s son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.It is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.But, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a \\"useless\\" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.James becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his \\"new\\" life or reclaim his \\"old\\" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.As the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and \\"fun\\" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James\' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.These are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed. The series was originally broadcast on PBS\'s Masterpiece Theatre, and was introduced each week by the late popular historian, Allistair Cooke.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Breathtaking Saga of True Life Returns!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1115251200, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2005"}\n',

When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah \\"On Trial\\" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah\'s position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, \\"There\'s no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,\\" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy\'s diatribe when James loses Rose\'s inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys \\"look after\\" the servants (\\"I hate to see servants humiliated,\\" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it\'s reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant\'s hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges\' delicious cakes (when she\'s not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I\'ll take it. There are no problems distracting enough to make it unwatchable. This remarkable series has stood the test of time and truly shines.  The fine writing, splendid acting and authentic sets involve the viewer in the stories to the extent that the minor jumps and glitches are unimportant.  My only complaint is that Alistair Cooke\'s wonderful introductions are not included.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Television\'s Finest Hours", "unixReviewTime": 1106352000, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2005"}\n',

I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling \\"artsy\\" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke\'s introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret\'s Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs \\"family\\". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their \\"upstairs\\" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both \\"families\\", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.This 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80\'s, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD\'s in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams\' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn\'t get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself.

The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It\'s like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said \\"authentic,\\" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.In addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in \\"Upstairs Downstairs,\\" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the \\"Upstairs\\" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the \\"Downstairs\\" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.Having said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that \\"the King will be dining with us next week.\\" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don\'t actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.Going now to the servants, there\'s Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There\'s also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in \\"The Hero\'s Farewell,\\" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won\'t be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.The last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.As companions to this series, I would like to recommend the \\"Berkeley Square\\" Series and Stephen Poliakoff\'s \\"The Lost Prince.\\" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that \\"Berkeley Square\\" had its roots in \\"Upstairs Downstairs.\\" To see \\"Berkeley Square\\" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing \\"Upstairs Downstairs.\\" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff\'s \\"The Lost Prince.\\" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff\'s best works. I guarantee that \\"Berkeley Square\\" and \\"The Lost Prince\\" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.Overall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode \\"Alberto\\" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an \\"R\\" rating. Other than that, it\'s mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.A word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn\'t give it a lot of expectations. I think there\'s a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don\'t mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there\'s not much of a bonus feature.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ten Stars for the Bellamy Household", "unixReviewTime": 1162080000, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2006"}\n',

Smith", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "The obvious flaw in this blu-ray collection of 9 Mel Brooks films is that it does not include all of Brooks\'s movies, most notably The Producers. I admit that I\'m inclined to forgive this because I already own that movie (probably my favorite comedy of all time) on DVD, and am perfectly happy not to double-up on owning it; and I also don\'t mind not having Life Stinks or Dracula: Dead and Loving It, as those are my two least favorite Brooks movies. So, yes, some movies are missing, and that is a totally valid criticism of this set.Looking at what is included, we see a whole lot of greatness. I particularly love Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, and Spaceballs, but even films that were less successful, like To Be or Not To Be, are at least enjoyable. The picture and sound quality are excellent, but I don\'t consider myself an expert on that subject: Blu-ray\'s great, but I think DVDs look pretty fantastic, too, so once you reach that level of quality, I\'m pretty happy with the presentation. The hardcover book that comes with the box is really nice, a loving tribute to the comedic master. Some other reviewers gripe about how the discs sit in their slots, and I would too, if these were CDs that I expected to take out frequently. Since they\'re movies, which I\'m sure to watch a number of times, but not every day, I don\'t think these slots will prove to be harmful to them.Overall, though it doesn\'t include every one of his films, this collection stands out as being a great presentation of 9 films, many of them classics.

So with that caveat out of the way let\'s talk about what is included- nine of the funniest movies ever released to the American public. Mel Brooks remains a master comic with an impeccable sense of timing and showmanship and these films represent the bulk of his incredible comic legacy. They are funny on SOO many levels and poke fun at lots of things, very little is sacred to hold up to ridicule with Brooks. He is a comic talent that does not hesitate to show that the emperor really has no clothes on. The jokes range from the infamous farting campfire scene which is still hilariously funny to some gags which require thought to &#34;Get.&#34; The laughs come fast and furiously though and are still as intense as I recall on first viewing them. Most of these movies could not be made today, as we have become so impacted by the &#34;Politically correct&#34; movement that we can\'t even mention the &#34;N&#34; word without castigation, and yet in &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; it is used no less than 17 times, by whites and blacks. The genius is that we can see how patently stupid racism is, a truth that is a two edged sword. Oh well, enough social commentary. How about the movies? There are NO clinkers here and for one price you get to watch all these movies in pretty convincing high definition, although the Blazing Saddles version is the older transfer, not the restored 30th anniversary edition. No matter, it still looks really really good and it is hard to imagine any of these films looking much better without the inevitable expensive and intensive restoration effort. I would grade them all a solid 8 out of 10 scale for video and almost as good for sound.There are those movies made for high definition which instill a sense of wonder in their detail and coloration, I am thinking of &#34;Blade Runner&#34; and the opening scenes of &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; and there are those that have incredible soundtracks which blow you away with the surround experience. The essence of Mel Brooks movies is your belly, as in lots and lots of belly laughs, which he successfully provides while making us appreciate the absurdity of such things as racism (Blazing Saddles), royalty (History of the Word Part 1), riots (Young Frankenstein), sexuality (Blazing Saddles- you will be like warm sauerkraut in Lilly\'s hands). Only Mel Brooks could pull off all these things and still make us laugh at ourselves and our own foibles. If this not the true essence of comedic genius, then what is?But relax, the visuals and the sound are wonderful, far far better than the old VHS tapes and even better than the movies I had collected on DVD. At the price asked for the movies you receive this is a bargain, and it can be had even lower priced if one buys when it is on a special sale. But you really can\'t go wrong, these are hilarious movies. There are only a handful of people who approach Brook\'s level of genius with comedy IMHO and even if you disagree, these are wonderful movies to have in any family collection. Just be sure to specify how you want them divided up in your will, you know like Baron Von Frankenstein did in his.

My brother found it in a small video store and rented it for me. This may very well be one of the most dark, depressing,and brilliant films I have ever seen.It\'s directed by Gary Oldman (known for his acting, or overacting, in Dracula, The Professional etc,) and he proves to be a great director. The movie is about a family with Ray Winstone as Ray, the father/husband of the household and Kathy Burke as Valerie. Ray is a working class lout who abuses both drugs and his wife. His son Billy (played by Charlie Creed-Miles) is a herion addict on the streets after his father nearly bites his nose off for stealing his smack. Ray is at times both scary and pittiful, mean and sad, nasty and pathetic. He intertwines these roles so well that at time\'s you can\'t tell where he is coming from, or what he\'ll do next. Valerie is just a simple wife who is just trying to keep her head down so she doesn\'t get it taken off. However even she is not imune to Ray\'s violent temper over nothing. In one very vicious scene she is attacked by Ray and although the beating take\'s place off-camera it still sends chills.I must warn anyone who wants to watch this movie the it contains more bad language that any I have ever seen (like Pulp Fiction, Scarface, or even South Park) but the profanity only hightens the dread at times. It also looks at life in a very dark way. This is not a happy movie by any means and Oldman has produced a real masterpiece. This has great acting and real good timing between the actors.

Gyurisin \\"good friend, damn fool\\"", "helpful": [10, 15], "reviewText": "Corporate America can be a very cruel place.  The constant attention towards competition, survival of the fittest, and determination towards top performance can easily drive the sanest employee into an early stage of insanity.  Thus, due to these pressures, employees are constantly found in a heated battle for the top spot or the illusive management position.  Many will step directly onto your abdomen to ensure a promotion or pay increase.  Even those friends that have helped you grow or develop over the past few years will think nothing of the steps to topple your next advancement.  This form of random competition in Corporate America is very rare to capture, much less on film, but famed director Neil LaBute did a bit of the impossible.  LaBute took the pressures of competition in Corporate America and camouflaged them using some stereotypes linked to \\"men\\" in the workplace.  While some will argue that LaBute is doing nothing but exploiting male sexism/egoism and only built a stronger \\"glass ceiling\\" for women, I saw this completely different.  Much like others, In the Company of Men initially enraged me due to the harsh treatment and depiction of women in the workplace, but then it occurred to me, that isn\'t what LaBute wants to show.  As I watched this film a second time, I saw the real reason that LaBute created this picture.  He wanted, and successfully accomplished, to show that you have to be smart both in your personal and business life if you want to succeed in this demolishing corporate world.LaBute\'s approach to this ingenious subject reminded me of how Soderbergh used \\"sex\\" to debunk his story in sex, lies, and videotape.  From the opening scene, we think we know what this movie is going to be about.  We think we understand that this is just going to be another \\"dark\\" comedy about how cruel the corporate world can be to women, but wildly LaBute (like Soderbergh) will pull the hypothetical wool over your eyes if you are not careful.  Sure, he opens up huge controversial issues like the subjugation of women, the power of \\"men\\" in the workplace, and how one nearly looses their soul to push further ahead, but when LaBute finally delivers that final moment to us, we forget these issues and see the truth behind this film.  This is not a movie about sexism (while it is used quite often to hide the real truth), but instead the power of manipulation, the power of emotion, and the ability to use your friends to reach the top.  This is the ultimate betrayal film.  After watching this film, I read some reviews that discussed how viewers hated LaBute for doing what he did to Christine, and that made me a bit angry.  I too was disturbed by Eckhart\'s performance, but by being upset about what happened to Christine, you miss the truth behind this film.  When I finished watching this movie, I was more upset with LaBute for what he did to Howard (Matt Malloy) than with Christine.How did this dramatic change occur?  How could a viewer feel more sympathy for Howard than with the weeping Christine?  LaBute has this amazing ability to cast believable actors that mold themselves well within their roles.  Matt Malloy plays the perfect ying to Aaron Eckhart\'s yang.  The two could not be closer to polar opposites, but the chemistry between them keeps us connected and glued to the screen.  Their relationship reminded me of every Hollywood movie where the popular jock is great friends with the insecure geek.  Malloy and Eckhart\'s relationship reminded me of the frat boy who happens to be a friend with the computer nerd.  There is no initial understanding of why these two are friends or why they have anything in common.  Sure, they went to the same college, but does that constitute life-long friendship?  I believe from the beginning of this film, and possibly further into the pre-text, Eckhart has Malloy on a plan.  We don\'t see the plan initially, but when it comes into light at the end, it hits us deep within our gut, giving us more pain than the Christine incident.  How did LaBute set this up so well?  Again, I state, Malloy and Eckhart.  These two were methodical, malicious, and very close to perfection with their characters.  We believed them.  They sold us on themselves, which needed to happen for LaBute to make his point.  Stacy Edwards is decent, but honestly LaBute could have had anyone in that role and we would have bought it.  Why?  Again, Malloy and Eckhart.LaBute did not just give us impassioned characters with devoted actors, but he also gave us an amazing story.  He used the power of language to give us our opening, plot, downfall, climax, and twisty ending.  It is not often in Hollywood that you see this technique used.  It takes a combination of both a great (and engrossing) story with sublime characters.  We already know that we had the characters, but what about the story made it worth watching over and over and over again.  Having seen American Psycho several times, I felt like LaBute had read Bret Easton Ellis\' novel over and over.  He embodied the spirit and insanity of corporate America nearly as well as American Psycho director Mary Harron did.  The pacing was tight, the six weeks seemed to fly by because we were glued to the results.  LaBute kept us glued to the screen by shocking us with sexist remarks, macho thinking, and corporate taboos.  Then, when he thought that we were not paying attention, he gave us the ending of a lifetime.  The writing for this film was quick, powerful, and thought provoking, which nearly symbolizes this film.  LaBute should have won an Oscar for this powerful and intelligent piece of cinema.Overall, I thought this film was vile, belittling, and grotesquely unsettling ... which is why I cannot wait to add it to my collection.  LaBute proves to us once again why he is a master behind the camera as well as a commander with his pen.  Aaron Eckhart should have been awarded an Oscar for his role, because I do not believe anyone could have played it better.  The chemistry between the characters felt fresh and original.  The story kept our minds moving quickly and desiring more.  I wanted to witness more opening events before the film what happened to these characters afterwards.

In the Company of Men tells the story of a few such gentlemen, and does so in what is supposed to be a realistic way, but I have a hard time believing that the characters here are acting realistically.A pair of men go on a six-week business stint out of town, working on an anonymous project for an anonymous large company. Chad (Aaron Eckhart) encourages Howard (Matt Malloy) to play a \\"game\\" with him while they are on this business trip. He proposes that they find a vulnerable girl and each begin dating her and treating her kindly, then at the end of the six weeks, pull the rug out from underneath her and bask in her agony. The purpose here being that in the future, when either of the two of them feels mistreated by a woman, they can look back on this and tell themselves at least it\'s not as bad as that. Howard isn\'t overly enthusiastic about the idea, but goes along with anyway.The pawn ends up being a secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards), who also happens to be deaf. Chad takes her out first, then Howard does the same. Things start to get complicated when Christine starts to develop feelings for Chad, but Howard starts to develop true feelings for Christine, and isn\'t sure he wants to be involved in this game anymore. Meanwhile, everything is going according to plan for Chad, and he is loving it.I think one of the points that this movie is trying to convey is that the most ruthless, heartless, sadistic individuals are able to succeed in business because they don\'t care who they step over while they\'re on their way up. Chad certainly fits that bill; he is absolutely despicable, almost to the point where he is a caricature, and it ultimately makes his character difficult to believe. There is virtually no way to sympathize with his character and that\'s because he\'s one-dimensional: he\'s a jerk and we should loathe him, and we do.The whole game just doesn\'t seem like it would ever happen. Why would a man like Howard go along with it? He seems much too smart and compassionate to agree to this heartless plan. When watching the film, though, I put aside my disbelief of the premise and found it to be pretty good. I liked the way director Neil LaBute allowed for long takes and really let the actors do their thing, and they did a very good job, especially Matt Malloy.

Chad (Aaron Eckhart) is a virile, handsome middle level manager capable of some charm.  However he doesn\'t relate to other people the way most people do.  He has some superficial tricks for getting close.  He tells women he likes the way they smell.  He knows they love that.  He bonds with men by appealing to their prejudices.

Chad spots her and decides she is perfect for this little game of broken hearts he wants to play with Howard (Matt Malloy), his slightly nerdy friend, co-worker and sometime boss.  We\'ll both date her, he says, and then dump her.  That way we\'ll get back at all the women who have done us dirt.  He has an ulterior motive as well.  He wants to destroy Howard, just to prove he can.What makes this film work is the sheer brutality of Chad\'s bloodless methods, and Director Neil LaBute\'s suffocating depiction of predatory life in the corporate structure.

As a result, it is not a film to be enjoyed (although I did laugh, in spite of myself, at a number of places throughout the film), but it is a fascinating and totally believable study of the cruelty that human beings are capable of. It is made all the more effective and frightening by the fact that this cruelty is executed in a bloodless (and legal) manner.

Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are business associates, ten years out of university (they attended the same school), and are about to embark on a six week special assignment in another city for their company.  As they wait to board their plane, Howard reveals to Chad that his girlfriend has just dumped him; aboard the plane, Chad shares with Howard that his girlfriend has just dumped him as well, in a quite insensitive manner, at that.  No warning, no note, just one day- gone- end of story.  Chad muses to Howard that things seem to be getting out of hand; women have the upper hand in relationships, and even worse, seemingly in the workplace, too (not to mention the competition from the younger guys coming up and already snapping at their heels, career wise).  \\"You can\'t even tell a joke in the workplace anymore,\\" he tells him.  And it\'s time to do something about it.  Toward that end, Chad hatches a scheme through which they can get back on top and \\"regain their dignity.\\"  And for the rest of their lives, no matter how bad their relationships go or what \\"they\\" do to them at work, they\'ll always have this one thing, something that\'s worse than anything anyone will ever have done to them.  At first Howard isn\'t sure, because it\'s so \\"out there,\\"  but Chad sells him on the idea, and they go to work.  Their plan is to do it over the next six weeks, then it\'s over and they\'re on their way home.  Back on top.  Forever.  So begins what can only be called a study in abject cruelty and humiliation and, moreover, of a sick mind that in many ways is more telling than anything gleaned from movies such as \\"The Silence Of The Lambs,\\" or \\"The Cell.\\"  What\'s so unsettling is the fact that Chad is so \\"normal;\\" the young, clean-cut, charismatic all-American role model type, and to discover that such a person is capable of such unconscionable behavior is enough to awaken the paranoia in even the most jaded observer.  The mere concept of Chad\'s scheme is so despicable even to contemplate, that to see it actually played out becomes almost unbearable at times to keep watching.  But you can\'t help yourself; LaBute\'s deft handling of his own material makes it so engrossing that you simply can\'t look away.  He takes you right down the path to where he wants you, and knows exactly which buttons to push along the way to keep you there.  Even against your own will.  Aaron Eckhart gives a remarkable, almost chilling, performance as Chad; to be able to create such a loathsome character, someone who can evoke such utter contempt, bespeaks his ability as an actor.  This is a guy you will not soon forget, and  may make you think twice about more than a few casual acquaintances and co-workers, while wondering if things or people are ever actually as they seem.  That Chad is someone with whom you can so readily identify (at least on the surface), makes this brush with him all the more disquieting.  To have to acknowledge his perverse power over others is even more so.  As ultimately one of the pawns in Chad\'s game, Matt Malloy gives a good performance as Howard, but it\'s a character for whom it is hard to muster much sympathy.  The most notable performance in the film, however, is turned in by Stacy Edwards (Christine).  It\'s a tough part, and she plays it to perfection with just the right touches of strength and vulnerability that gain her the empathy of the audience while making her an entirely sympathetic and memorable character.  A hard-hitting drama punctuated with a driving score (that is especially effective during the transitions of the passing weeks), \\"In The Company Of Men\\" will get your adrenaline pumping and make your blood boil at the same time.  It\'s a sad commentary on society, but a wake-up call with a moral just the same.  It\'s a case of acquainting oneself with ugliness, that one may then recognize and appreciate true beauty.

The story goes where it needs to, without regard to Hollywood convention.  No happy ending here.  In the big studio version, Billy Crystal would play Chad; Tom Hanks, Howard; and Meg Ryan, Christine.

Sure, it has to do with those things, but ultimately those are sideshows.  What many don\'t realize, but what\'s central to this quintessential story of the 1990s is that it\'s really an allegory about Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and their stormy relationship with American people.Chad, of course, is Clinton stripped down to an everyman mid-level executive; Howard is nothing more than Clinton\'s unwitting rival, Gingrich; and Christine, and Chad\'s live-in girlfriend, are nothing less than the voters, at once wooed, seduced, betrayed, and wounded by their erstwhile suitors.  Howard, recently selected to head an important project just as Gingrich had recently become House Speaker, is in over his head-and heart-amid shark-infested waters.  And who better to eat him alive than the honcho shark himself, Chad/Bill?  Eager to please, confused about principles, lacking killer instincts, drunk on imagined power, and unable to discipline his emotions, Howard/Newt hasn\'t a chance against his ruthlessly conniving assassin.

The updating of both the \\"new\\" Godzilla and his three-headed nemesis King  Ghidorah is worthy of the original movies directed by Ishiro Honda...and  that\'s saying a lot.  While colder in tone than Honda\'s films (some of the  sense of wonder in the kaiju world was lost in Kazuo Omori\'s direction),  the story about the creation of Godzilla and the plot of subversive  terrorists from the future planning to destroy 20th-century Japan via King  Ghidorah is overall a good one.  Godzilla has been revamped in what I  personally consider the best suit of the Heisei series.  Kawakita\'s special  effects are for the most part magnificent, even if his King Ghidorah flies a little  stiffly at times.  Eiji Tsubaraya must have been smiling down on Kawakita  for this film. Anna Nakagawa is particularly good as Emmy, the woman from  the future who turns against her fellow future bad guys.  But the movie  really belongs to longtime Godzilla great Yoshio Tsuchiya, who steals the  show as the industrialist Shindo, whose life was spared in World War II by  Godzilla, only to later see the business empire he built destroyed by the Big G.  And if this weren\'t enough, Godzilla alumni Akira Ifukube returns with a  huge, sprawling score that recalls the glorious past of the kaiju eiga.  This movie is right up there with \\"Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla  II\\"...it\'s that good.  As always, I have a problem with the dubbing, but  what else is new?

Much like GOLDFINGER (released the same year), which was almost universally considered to be the finest James Bond film prior to the release of CASINO ROYALE, by all explanations MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA shouldn\'t be so good.  Nevertheless, it is inexplicably the finest sequel in the Showa series.The plot involves a mysterious giant egg that washes up on the shores of Japan, attracting the attention of greedy businessmen who \\"purchase\\" the egg.  Meanwhile, a scientist, a reporter, and a rookie photographer are trying to discover what the egg really belongs to when they encounter two small fairies, who tell them that the egg is Mothra\'s egg.  Mothra is, of course, a giant moth, who made her debut in her own kaiju flick, 1961\'s MOTHRA (also directed by the great Ishiro Honda).  Though the trio tries to convince the businessmen to return the egg to Mothra, they will do no such thing.  Then who emerges to liven things up but the Big G himself, looking more ferocious than he did before or did in any film afterwards.  Can Mothra protect her egg and save Japan from the menace of Godzilla, or will Japan\'s worst (and biggest) enemy be having scrambled eggs for his next entree?Ishiro Honda really knew what he was doing with this film.  The pacing is perfect: not too rushed, but not slow to the point where one begins screaming for a monster to pop up and wreak some havoc.  The screenplay is humorous and very fun, and Akira Ifukube\'s music is spectacular.  The Godzilla suit used for this film, \\"Mosugoji\\", is a fan favorite due to its more nasty, reptilian look.

And Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, American Everyman, hasn\'t been better before or since, in my opinion.  Plus, the film boasts the legendary Francois Truffaut.  The special effects, amazing for the day, continue to jawdrop.The sound and picture quality are flawless, especially the DTS track, which resonates with the voices of the otherworldly.  The documentary, culled from the laserdisc version, is excellent, and even better than a commentary.  It offers insight into the making of one of the most important science fiction films ever made.

While Roland Emmerich\'s ID4 is a throwback to 1950s \\"invaders from space\\" flicks, Spielberg\'s vision of a \\"close encounter\\" between humanity and extraterrestrials is more mysterious and, in the end, more hopeful and awe-inspiring.  Instead of exchanging bullets and \\"heat rays,\\" humans and aliens communicate by using musical notes.Spielberg\'s screenplay divides Close Encounters roughly into three acts, basically corresponding to each of the three kinds of  \\"encounters.\\"In the first category, sightings of a UFO, we first see a very strange sight in the Mexican desert: an international team of researchers led by French UFO expert Lacombe (the late Francois Truffaut) and guided by several Mexican Federales finds five World War II vintage Grumman TBM Avengers.  The planes are abandoned but strangely intact, as though they were brand new.  \\"Who flies this kind of plane?\\" asks a bewildered cartographer/interpreter named Laughlin (Bob Balaban).\\"No one,\\" replies another astonished researcher. \\"This is Flight 19.\\"(Flight 19, of course, is a reference to a Navy training flight which took off from Ft. Lauderdale one morning in December 1945 and vanished, along with a Martin Mariner search plane sent up to look for the missing planes and crews.  Flight 19 is now famous in the lore of unsolved mysteries related to the Bermuda triangle.)Laughlin is baffled by something else, as well.  A Mexican villager, old, sunburned, and seemingly delirious, keeps repeating, \\"El sol salio anoche y me canto. El sol salio anoche y me canto.\\"  When Laughlin asks what the phrase mean, a researcher who is fluent in Spanish says, in an awed tone, \\"He says the sun came out last night.  He says it sang to him.\\"Later, in the Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, a more dramatic close encounter of the first kind plays out on the radar scopes as airliner pilots call in reports of bright lights in the sky and unknown contacts make their presence known.  For a few tense minutes it look as though tragedy is imminent, but within moments the contacts vanish into the night sky.  Torn between reporting a UFO sighting or just letting the incident slide by, pilots and air traffic controllers alike opt to keep quiet, mainly to avoid having to fill out tons of bureaucratic paperwork.As important as these sequences are, the focus of Spielberg\'s story is on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an employee of a Midwestern power company whose life on Earth is ordinary, hectic, and somewhat unfulfilling.  Sent out to investigate a section of power lines in rural Indiana (caused, of course, by the UFOs\' passage), Neary has a close encounter of the first kind and impulsively goes on a truck-borne pursuit of two small \\"flying saucers.\\"  This sequence, which ends with a Keystone Kops-like police chase of the same UFOs, triggers an obsession within Neary that neither his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) nor his children will understand, much less accept.  Neary, along with several hundred other people from different towns and states, will soon be haunted by both a visual image and a simple five-note musical phrase.  The traces of the UFO flights that leave traces behind (sunburn on people who, like Neary, were exposed to bright light at night) are known as close encounters of the second kind.Spielberg weaves Neary\'s everyman-faces-an-extraordinary- situation plot with the official investigations being carried out by the UN-sponsored Lacombe team and a more secretive U.S. government First Contact program.  These plot threads will all lead to a climactic and awe-inspiring close encounter of the third kind: actual (and documented) contact between humanity and another space-faring civilization.The Columbia/Tri-Star Collector\'s Edition brings not only a newly re-edited version (trimming some excess material from the 1980 Special Edition) of the 1977 film, but also comes with a second disc loaded with extras such as a Laurent Bouzereau documentary on the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a 1977 promotional featurette, and the theatrical trailers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "We are not alone.....", "unixReviewTime": 1062633600, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2003"}\n',

I have rediscovered it now, thanks to DVD, and am kicking myself for not getting better acquainted with it after all these years. It isn\'t a stretch to say that Close Encounters may be the best Alien movie. Spielberg also wrote the film(and why hasn\'t he written a truckload more?), and it\'s a wonderful accomplishment still after 30 years. The great Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neery, a middle class, suburban husband and father who has a \'close encounter\' when UFO\'s begin to come into his town of Muncie, Indiana. And what a great scene that is!. Roy and a few others, including single mom Melinda Dillon(A Christmas Story), end up with a connection to the UFO\'s as the aliens inside try to make contact with earthlings. Spielberg has a great sense of feeling and wonder thru the entire film. He shows us how this could be taken in two ways. One, he gives us the whimsical, fantastical, awe-inspiring side, and with a fantastic sequence in Dillon\'s house with her son, also gives us how this can be frightening and scary. One look at that scene and you can see how this movie heavily influenced Shyamalan\'s \\"Signs\\". The movie was made 30 years ago, but it holds up strongly. It\'s 30 year old story and effects are more affective than a lot of the films today with millions of dollars and fancy new technology. Dreyfuss is always good, and he\'s great here as Neery. Teri Garr plays his wife. The home life aspect of the fillm doesn\'t work for some, but it\'s part of what made the movie to me. Seeing how this normal, average joe gets sucked up in this obsession and how it starts to affect the family life. Garr doesn\'t get a whole lot here, but she seems to get across that she is a woman who doesn\'t know what to do. The late director Francois Truffaut plays a scientist, along with Bob Balaban, tracking the UFO\'s and the strange occurences that have happened around the world. The score by Spielberg mainstay, John Williams, is another success in his long cannon of work. Beautiful and haunting, and who will forget those few chords?. The end is still remarkably fresh and amazing, and the mother ship itself is more cool and impressive than a lot of what we can see nowadays in movies. It\'s grand entrance is still amazing and a great accomplishment in filmmaking. The smaller ships that come and go are equally fun and well done. Close Encounters has a lot of great things going for it. There are a number of great/classic scenes, a wonderful score, good acting, and a sense of awe and wonder that Spielberg is so brilliant at capturing. You gotta love early, 1975-82, Spielberg. The fact that this movie remains to be so good and touching and amazing 30 years on and before all the studio money that goes out nowadays is a testament to the film and Spielberg\'s talents.

I have only really liked him in two movies -- George Lucas\' American Grafitti and Steven Spielberg\'s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Until recently, I had only seen bits and pieces of Spielberg\'s 1977 UFO classic. I never had the time or inclination to sit down and watch the whole movie. That is, until my current boyfriend (a true Spielberg aficionado) purchased the Collector\'s Edition DVD. We sat down in my living room and watched it.What surprised me about Spielberg\'s film is how well the story of a peaceful encounter between humanity and a spacefaring civilization is told. Not only are the 1977 special effects still effective, but the human interest part of Close Encounters was compelling. As seen mostly from the point of view of Indiana electrical engineer Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), the movie depicts the mystery and wonder of how we discover that we are not alone in this universe. It shows that even though Neary loses almost everything to the compulsion mysteriously implanted into his mind, he eventually finds that his sacrifices were worth it.The movie is never boring. Instead, even though it\'s not a film like Star Wars with ray guns and explosions, it\'s fast-paced and interesting. It takes its cues from actual UFO sightings and other unexplained mysteries (such as Flight 19, the 5-plane training flight that disappeared off the coast of east Florida in December of 1945) and ends up with a realistic scenario for a &quot;close encounter&quot; between humans and aliens. The acting is excellent, and the young Spielberg got great performances not only from Dreyfuss, but also from Teri Garr (Veronica Neary), Melinda Dillon (Gillian Guiller), Francois Truffaut (Lacombe) and Gary Guffey (Barry). Also adding to the magic was composer John Williams, whose 5-note musical phrase became famous as the proof that music is truly a universal language.The two-disc collector\'s edition includes the movie in wide screen format, with a second disc that contains a making-of documentary, eleven deleted scenes, plus theatrical trailers. Both picture and sound are excellent and considering it\'s a two-DVD set, the price is affordable.

The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It\'s a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you\'ve gone on an emotional journey as well.The movie\'s slow pace and subtle cinematography are a nice change from most movies released nowadays. At over 2 hours, the movie crawls for most of the time presenting dialogue and images. Initially, that sounds like a recipe for disaster (or 2001 Space Odyssey) but it works really well in this context. Slowing the pace down allows viewers to feel like you\'re traveling with the characters and for the tension to build. It also makes the climax all the more rewarding.The special effects still hold up pretty well and have been improved for this 30th anniversary edition. I haven\'t watched this on blu-ray so I don\'t know how the quality holds up there. I did think some of the blacks could have been cleaned up to remove some of the \\"static,\\" but I have to say it also gives the movie a nice \\"older\\" feel.Overall, this is a sci-fi classic and still probably the most realistic depiction of contact with aliens ever to come out of Hollywood.

Steven Spielberg wrote and directed this tremendous science fiction film with his own distinctive middle-class view on things.Richard Dreyfuss is at his usual terrific best in the role of Ron Neary, another of Spielberg\'s &quot;Everyman&quot; characters.  He is an Indiana power lineman who is called out on a night where the entire city of Muncie goes dark.  Then, at a railroad crossing, he is suddenly shocked by the appearance of a UFO, flooding him with brilliant white light.  This encounter soon turns both him and his life upside down; his wife (Teri Garr) and kids can\'t understand his obsession with turning the shape of mashed potatoes or mounds of dirt from his backyard into a mysterious mountain he\'s been seeing in his mind.  Meanwhile, a lonely mother (Melinda Dillon) has her own close encounters with the UFOs, resulting in the still-unseen aliens abducting her son (Cary Guffey).  She too has visions of a mysterious mountain, visions which find their way into paintings and colorings.When the news comes on TV with word that a train supposedly loaded with deadly nerve gases has overturned in northeastern Wyoming, however, both Dreyfuss and Dillon know the locale--Devils Tower.  In spite of government officials closing the park off to outsiders (the nerve gas leak is an elaborate cover story), Dreyfuss and Dillon witness, along with a noted UFO expert (Francois Truffaut, director of the 1969 classic THE WILD CHILD) and hundreds of others, the first actual close encounter of the third kind--direct physical contact between Earthlings and extra-terrestrials.Spielberg\'s film was obviously a radical shift from most previous Hollywood depictions about outer space visitations to Earth.  He evokes the famous line &quot;Watch The Skies&quot; from Howard Hawks\' 1951 classic THE THING, but does so without the paranoia and hysteria of the space invasion films of the 1950s.  There are no lasers or bug-eyed monsters.Because CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America\'s twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, a &quot;don\'t-let-the-military handle this&quot; approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick\'s 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams\' score...what more needs to be said; it\'s brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond\'s cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.Well conceived, suspenseful, occasionally terrifying, and finally uplifting, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is yet one more staggering masterpiece for a director with a whole lot of masterpieces still to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "We Are Not Alone", "unixReviewTime": 1008288000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2001"}\n',

The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them.The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman.What is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.This film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King\'s Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Discover our distant lovers from outspace", "unixReviewTime": 990576000, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2001"}\n',

Every child and adult should see it.Definatly a movie that should be seen in the theater.  Perhaps it should be re-released again.This film has an all-star cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon, Bob Balaban, Francois Truffaut and George Di Cenzo.The film is perfectly cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon and the young kids.Rod Nerry (Richard Dreyfuss) is married to Ronnie (Teri Garr).  They have three children (Shawn Bishop, Adrienne Campbell, Justin Dreyfuss).  He is also a sensitive man.  One night he drives to a rural area and stops at a railroad crossing.

There is some kind of storm brewing over.  The toys suddenly come on, the vaccuum is running around, the kitchen is a mess.  Later, after her son is taken by a bright light, she too has these visions of something.  Some people have the same vision and it leads them to one specific place in the United States.Disc Two includes a 1 hour and 41 minute documentary, \\"The Making Of Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\".  Very interesting details about filming locations,casting, a deleted scene, and seven new scenes added into the 1980 re-issue called \\"Special Edition: Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\".  Also on Disc Two, an over 4-minute theatrical trailer of the original film and a theatrical trailer for the \\"Special Edition\\" version.  An over 5-minute 1977 featureete of the original film.  Over 15 unseen deleted scenes not seen in the original and not the \\"Special Edition\\", except for the \\"Special Edition\\" ending which is shown.The original \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" was released in 1977.  It ran at 2 hours, 15 minutes.  In 1980, Steven Spielberg re-worked the film cutting some scenes out and adding newly-filmed scenes with more of Richard Dreyfuss inside the Mothership.  It also included the song, \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" in end credits.For the ABC Network version in the 1980\'s, another version of the film was made.  It included the \\"Special Edition\\", but with \\"all existing footage\\" from the original film also added.  It ran at over 2 hours and 20 minutes.In 1998, Steven Spielberg again re-edited the film for a \\"Collector\'s Edition\\".  It does not include the \\"Special Edition\\" ending of inside the Mothership with Richard Dreyfuss.  It ran 2 hours and 17 minutes.All of us fans hope that some day soon, Steven Spielberg may release the ultimate longest version with the original footage and the \\"special edition\\" footage and the additional network-tv footage all together in the movie itself and release it on DVD.  A full-screen version (standard) would be nice too.

But the story was re-worked and ultimatly became,E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector\'s Edition)(1982).Richard Dreyfuss and Teri Garr worked together again in,Let It Ride(1989).The Alien leader that was seen towards the end of \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" also makes an appearance in CGI-animated form inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition)(2008).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "There are UFo\'s behind big clouds.", "unixReviewTime": 1101168000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2004"}\n',

Neary\'s just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he\'s never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.&quot;Close Encounters&quot; also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole &quot;just plain folks involved with something magical&quot; storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg\'s use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what\'s apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can\'t help but admire Spielberg\'s ability to get to the emotional core of this material.Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There\'s Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary\'s kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary\'s potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary\'s doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband\'s selfish midlife crisis.The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.

A single mother named Jillian (Melinda Clarke) who\'s son was abducted by a UFO also helps with Roy and other ones that have encountered the strange Unidentified Flying Object especially French researcher Claude Lacombe (Francois Trauffaut) has a believe that music can be a language of the strange beings. The witnesses including the government and researchers head to Devil\'s Peak in Wyoming to make a special meeting place to meet the alien beings.A magical, intelligent and stunning Sci-fi drama adventure from Steven Spielburg is a philosphial and unique motion picture experience. The performances by the cast are outstanding and the special effects that still outstand including the film\'s originally thanks to the magic of Steven Spielburg. This movie was a large labor of love for the writer-director but it was worth it to bring a fantastical and smart story to the big screen in a successful way, it made audiences believe in UFOs and if we are alone in the galaxy.This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set is incredible! this has quality picture and superb sound quality. This set has three versions like the original version, 1980 special edition and Director\'s cut with great extras like three featurettes, deleted scenes, storyboard comparision & Gallery, Location Scouting Pictures, Behind The Scenes pics, Production Team gallery, Portrait Gallery, Marketing gallery on both original and special editions and Trailers to all three versions.This is a must have Blu-Ray for fans of Sci-fi and cinema everywhere! this is one movie to truly experience better on Blu-Ray.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A sci-fi classic now on Blu-Ray!", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}\n',

This is one that could be enjoyed even by those who hate science fiction films.  The plot is amazing and, in my opinion, this film needs to be regarded as the standard setting sci-fi film of the 70\'s, just as 2001: A Space Odyssey was in the 60\'s.  Also, the acting was just astounding, especially on the part of Richard Dreyfus.In conclusion I wanted to add in response to the reviewer below that it is more like good riddance to a witch of a wife.  Teri Garr did a splendid job of playing a wife who\'s head was completely in the sand and was not supportive of her husband at all.  I mean, if I had a loser wife like this, then I would be really tempted, alien encounter or not, to trash my living room and build a replica of Devil\'s Tower in my living room so she would think I was crazy and would leave me... FOR GOOD!!  Or, better yet, have the aliens abduct her, harvest her organs so they could see what a LOUSY EARTHLING WIFE IS MADE OF!!Anyway, all ranting aside, this film is highly entertaining very awe-inspiring.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb Sci-Fi masterpiece from Spielberg.

This Close Encounters of the Third Kind DVD set is affordable and it spoils you rotten! It has the 1977 theatrical version, the 1980 special edition, and the 1998 director\'s cut! Also, there\'s some extra features. I first saw Close Encounters when I rented a VHS tape from the video store in 1998. Roy(Richard Dreyfuss) encounters a UFO while stuck at a railroad crossing. He has a vision of a tower in his mind. Director Steven Spielberg succeeded in casting French film director Francois Truffaut as a French scientist. Melinda Dillon plays a single mother and lovely Terri Garr plays Roy\'s wife. The special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Greg Jein, Ralph McQuarrie, and Dennis Muren are superb. The animatronic extraterrestrials built by Carlo Rambaldi are first rate. John Williams\' music score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind is flawless. The five note motif was spoofed by a school band on a TV show and in the 007 film Moonraker(1979). This film has the iconic scene with Roy making a tower with mashed potatoes. This scene was spoofed in UHF(1989) and The Simpsons.The 1977 version of Close Encounters shows Terri Garr listening to an officer talking about UFO\'s. The 1980 version of the film shows the bright, colorful inside of the mothership. Cary Guffey is quite good as a three year old who is kidnapped by aliens. Close Encounters came out in 1977; it had to compete with Star Wars. Both films were referenced in Independence Day(1996). Times have changed. Steven Spielberg directed War of the Worlds(2005) and that film showed us some nasty, malevolent aliens from Mars. In the 1970\'s and the 1980\'s, Spielberg was willing to show us optimistic tales of encounters with space aliens. Close Encounters is a keeper.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977)", "unixReviewTime": 1308873600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2011"}\n',

Ross \\"Kristy\\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of Spielberg\'s most personal films, and one of his best DVDs. Originally released in 1977, Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980, then altered it again for the film\'s 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in. This DVD is the definitive version of Spielberg\'s classic, with the extra sections making the film\'s progress more involving than when it was first released.Extra stuff aside, does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction? The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Different from other nihlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film\'s conclusion.Dreyfuss, who also starred in Spielberg\'s own Jaws (1975), is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic.
