Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK \'99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you\'ll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original \'69  Woodstock documentary (which, let\'s face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn\'t even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It\'s too bad the producers didn\'t see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I\'ll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original \'69 documentary so  great.

Profoundly simple and beautifully capturing the feel of the \\"ancient\\" in this updated setting.Frode Olsen\'s President Valens opens the work declaring that his gods are to be worshiped and his happy followers (each carrying an American soft drink, which I thought to be a minor unfortunate directorial choice) rouse and begin the first of the big hand gestures which will occur throughout the rest of the night.  For once Sellars\' use of hand gestures not only appropriate but excitingly useful.  Olsen\'s rather large voice was exciting and reminded me a little of Triegle\'s turn as Giulio Cesare.As two of the president\'s main guards, David Daniels (Didymus) and Richard Croft (Septimius) are magnificent.  While much is written about Daniels, I have for years been amazed by the sheer beauty of Richard Croft\'s voice.  I have always been a fan, and his singing here evoked beautiful memories of a Semele a few years back where his \\"Where \'er you walk\\" won the prize for the most beautiful singing I\'ve experienced live.It is nearly impossible to separate Sellars direction of \\"Theodora\\" from the vocal performances - there is so much going on, indeed, the entire work achieves a nearly balletic performance.  I would imagine it, in our era especially, to strip sexuality from a stage work, to be extremely difficult.  Sellars, early on, establishes same sex bonding, first between Didymus & Septimius, later Theodora and Irene with such beauty, gentleness and honesty that later, when men and women are touching it is neverperceived as sexual - rather compassion.One of the most beautiful of images occurs during Septimius\' aria \\"Descend kind pity, heavenly guest.\\"  Sellars has created a pas de deux between the two soldiers Croft alone singing, imploring heaven\'s pity. At the downward scale sung on the word \\"descend\\" Didymus\' arms repeat a falling motion finally encircling Septimius.  When Septimius faces up and sees his fellow soldier he is startled, profoundly touched, wiping tears from his eyes. We witness a bonding deeper than either foreshadowing the compassion and highlighting the similarities between these two different men. It doesn\'t hurt that Croft sings with the most ravishing tone one is likely to ever encounter in this role.Late his bravura aria \\"Dread the fruits of Christian folly\\" lets him sing what may be the fastest coloratura I\'ve heard a tenor execute.  His performance, as well as Lorraine Hunt Lieberson are the highlights of this extraordinarily beautiful evening.Of Ms. Hunt, all I can ask is: has there EVER been a better singer of this type of music?  Her Irene is simply an overwhelmingly powerful presence. Sellars has cast Irene as the leader of the Christian sect to which Theodora belongs.  She is obviously and  passionately devoted to her congregation and it is clear this community would follow her to the ends of the world.  Irene has some of the best music in \\"Theodora\\" and Hunt singsit with such passion and aching beauty, nowhere (for me)more than in \\"As with rosey steps the morn.  This is one of Handel\'s most exquisitely beautiful arias and Hunt\'s singing of this is simply ravishing.  She is up to big coloratura work in \\"Bain of Virtues\\" and her ornamentation in the di capo is thrilling stuff.Dawn Upshaw\'s Theodora is one of the best things she\'s ever done.  The image of her, in simple white, rising from her chair at what looks like a prayer meeting is a stunning image as she begins her aria \\"Fond flattering world adieu.\\"  Her voice was built for this type of slow Handel aria.  Sellars gives her some of the grandest arm/hand gestures ofthe cast and Upshaw\'s execution of them was believable - never once looking artificial, rather as if merely another extension of the music.  \\"Angels ever bright and fair\\" provides another stunning visual moment - when Septimius, with his soldiers, reluctantly but dutifully leads her away to \\"that vile place.\\"  The arresting image of Theodora in virginal white, and the soldiers in their orange riot gear is hard to forget.The prison scene, a darkened stage with a large yellow square representing her cell finds Theodora in a red bathrobe over a white slip. Upshaw\'s movements become Martha Grahams all tortured angles and match the coloring of her singing.  Foregoing her typical pure sound Upshaw is unafraid to emit painful, frightened sobs and frenzied hyperventilating, unifying physical and vocal performance into a dramatic whole.  The image of her on the floor, palms and feet extending upward, robe barely wrapped around her magnificently projects the image of a renaissance saint ascending to heaven.William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the Glyndebourne chorus are completely \\"on\\" throughout the entire performance.

She won\'t worship Caesar\'s gods, by Jove.  In Sellars\' retelling, Caesar becomes the American president and the Roman centurions becomeU. S. Navy personnel in orange flight suits with American flags on their sleeves.  But this is clearly not a mere updating for audiences unfamiliar with any history prior to Britney Spear\'s latest commitment.  Despite the DVD cover\'s claim that the parable is \\"timeless,\\" Sellars is, in fact, shamelessly subverting Handel\'s work to serve a very timely and political purpose-- to bash America.  Bill (There\'s-no-easy-way-to-say-I\'ve-sinned) Clinton was in office when this video was released (1996), so it is not just an attack on George (Mission Accomplished) Bush.  It is nonpartisan in its contempt for a militaristic America.But why would Sellars choose a work celebrating Christianity to make his point when, according to enlightened European thought, the trouble with America is that it is too religious?  If the American president really did persecute Christians-- as Sellars claims on the surface-- wouldn\'t that be cause for Sellars and his Glyndebourne audience to celebrate?  Obviously, what Handel understood as Christianity is not what Sellars has in mind.  In Sellars\' theology, the nominal Christians of today are death-dealing hypocrites, and the atheist-- but \\"spiritual\\"!-- enlightened folks are the \\"Christians.\\"  These touchy-feely \\"Christians\\" are comfortable with their bodies and often appear to be in orgasmic swoons.  No doubt they eat organic vegetables and drive hybrids.  And they are persecuted by diet-Coke-drinking Caesar worshippers who, to cap things off, still practice capital punishment by lethal injection.Is this an effective co-opting of religion for radical purposes?  Hardly.  As a number of reviewers have noted, the transcendent beauty of Handel\'s music makes Sellars\' trendy gimmicks irrelevant.  I wonder about the singers.  Is it that hard to get a gig these days that one has to sing for the likes of Sellars to put food on the table?  Besides, Sellars won\'t get any kudos from Richard Dawkins (The God Delusion) or the other pop intellectuals who have had a belly full of people trying to reinterpret religion to salvage something of value.  Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and others suggest that real religion stinks and that it is time to simply dump it and move on.  Sellars should listen up and employ his talents where they fit most naturally-- say in a new production of the Vagina Monologues.

The story of a holy love between two persons isn`t so common in the operas.

The countertenor David Daniels as Dydimus makes an outstanding role; his aria The rapture`d soul defies the sword in the first act is powerful; he squints a little and this deed yields a special effect to hear him; besides his duet with Upshaw Streams of pleasure ever flowing (third act) is superb: the best duet I have heard in a haendelian opera. Frode Olsen as Valens makes the best role in this opera: his character`s wickedness is almost natural; his aria Racks, gibbets, sword and fire (first act) is powerful.

Not that this film doesn\'t have an all-age appeal, but who remembers the original comic book, which was far more gritty and mature than what public television might\'ve allowed? Granted, it\'s hard to sell the idea of four anthromorphic, ninjutsu-practicing, pizza-loving reptiles to begin with, but once the magic of Jim Henson sets in, a rather simplistic storyline becomes a most refreshing display of kung fu, comedy, and rubber suits that goes beyond expectations.These rubber suits are, of course what sells the movie. Create a costume of a 6-foot turtle that will look good in casual circumstances as well as in stylized combat, and you\'re close to getting yourself a winner. Master puppetry, coupled with fantastic athletic displays and individual voice-acting cements the four brothers (Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatella) as completely believable characters, immersed in an underground (and, eventually, street-top) battle with a villian - the armoured Shredder - whose spectacle is kept revered throughout the film by an unfaltering darkness to his character, highlighted by real-life crimes of child recruitment. Insert Judith Hoag into her tailor-made role of the reporter, April O\'Neil, and wiley Elias Koteas into the character of suave streetfighter Casey Jones, and both of their abilities to react believably to people in costumes, and you\'ve got yourself a winner.Well, maybe not yet. Though one can\'t expect much out of an action film when it comes to storylines, \\"Turtles\\" pulls it off by filling the fast-paced, quick-evented timeline with enough personality to make up for the relative speedy plot, which includes abduction, ambush, capture, retreat, reconciliation, emotional unearthing, return, battle-battle, and victory - all within 90 minutes. While I would have enjoyed certain aspects of the story (mainly, the time of the story spent between scenes) to be elaborated on more than they were, you can only praise the film for managing to plausibly tell the entire storyline of the original comic in the time that it did, by giving necessary focus on the multi-dimensional proportions of key scenes (ex: the reprieve at the farm, the Shredder\'s corraling of his recruits). In conclusion, the film pulls off the storytelling as well as and maybe even better than most other action films, securely a good mark in the field, but keeping it from being perfect (maybe if the film had been 30 minutes longer...).By keeping everything in context with the original publication, and by throwing in just the right amount of quirky humor, the film achieves most of its potential. A $13 million budget and collaboration with Jim Henson pay off by producing a cult film which sequels have yet to top (as well as a worldwide profit of about $200 million), and which cinematic history has yet to render obsolete.For fans of the franchise, this film is an absolute must-buy. Casuals viewers who find nothing wrong with talking, butt-kicking turtles and nifty kung-fu should likewise find no fault in this film.

The singing is wonderful, I loved the beautiful settings, costumes, awesome ballet and the music by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was excellent. It\'s the opera itself that was so butchered (on the back of the DVD it says that the movie \\"stays true to Verdi\'s opera,\\" so that was very misleading to me.) I could\'ve handled a couple arias taken out, but so much of the libreto was taken out that the story kind of didn\'t make sense. Besides some of the recitatives were taken out, some arias were cut short (or missing altogether), and then I can recall in the third act two arias put together as if they were one, which didn\'t sound right at all. It seemed like most of what was taken out was Alfredo\'s parts, and because of that, you really don\'t see the passion between Violetta and Alfredo. You only really see it with Violetta for Alfredo. It was just all a mess to me, and it only seemed to get worse as the opera continued. The music, at least with my copy, was off lot with the singers lips which was annoying. And the subtitles only showed up on the screen sometimes...sometimes they would be on the acreen, sometimes not (even for a whole song, like when the gypsies come out.)

This DVD is three previously released videos from the 80\'s and early 90\'s, Dance On Fire, Live At The Hollywood Bowl, and The Soft Parade.Dance On Fire is a slow start for the DVD, it is formatted like a 60\'s era LP, a collection of songs strung together that may or may not have a connection to each other. Jim Morrison once suggested that between tracks on a Doors album they should put some of his poems which is exactly what happens here between each video is a poem by Morrison.Some of the video\'s are rare such as the rarely seen Elektra promotional film of Break On Through. Others were created in the 80\'s, directed by Ray Manzarek with the specific intention to be video\'s shown on MTV, such as Wild Child, and surely the centerpiece of this is meant to be L.A. Woman. L.A. Woman is almost entirely shot by Ray without any vintage Doors footage and has a mini drama of a prostitute and a serial killer, with John Doe from the band X as the killer. It gets a little bogged down in the middle instrumental section as Ray gets in some esoteric artsy images. But it also has the iconic image of the L.A. highway at night, that looks like liquid light swarming around L.A. and Oliver Stone liked it so much \\"borrowed\\" it for his movie The Doors.Live At The Hollywood Bowl-filmed on July 5, 1968.The Doors gave this show at the Hollywood Bowl for Dave Diamond, a DJ who supported The Doors early on. Famously, Mick Jaeger and Keith Richard were in the audience that night so there might have been a little pressure on The Doors. Afterwards, a reporter is supposed to have asked Jaeger how he liked The Doors and he said `not really,\' but this always sounded like rock star jealousy to me.The concert is The Doors on a somewhat sedate night, not that they weren\'t good but some of the theatricality and tension isn\'t there. What is really cool about this concert is that it\'s just the Hollywood Bowl footage, no editing from other concerts or performances to make the video more dynamic, and the sound is live.The highlight of this DVD has to be The End. Morrison starts with his famous rap to the light man, \\"hey, Mr. light man turn down the lights,\\" and has an extra poetic section about being at a party and there\'s an accident outside. It\'s classic Doors, and a very cool version of The End. Also, are bits of Celebration of the Lizard used as introductions to more well known Doors songs such as Light My Fire.The Soft ParadeThis is Ray\'s answer to Oliver Stone\'s The Doors movie. Ray has contended that Stone\'s movie didn\'t show the Jim Morrison he knew, the funny, articulate, thoughtful Jim Morrison.This section starts hot! With The Changeling and you\'re immediately swept into the world of The Doors, as they travel through airports, backstage and with their significant others. Ray\'s wife Dorothy is featured, as is Pam Courson (Morrison\'s cosmic mate)and Jim, and Robby\'s future wife.  We see The Doors in a recording session of the song Wild Child and you see a bit of how they built a song. The erudite Morrison is shown in the PBS interview with Richard Goldstein, and the humorous Jim, in a segment a minister at large confronts Jim and Morrison explains \\"I can try to explain anything.\\" In this same section you\'re able to see a roadie picking cable and some sources think it\'s Harrison Ford making a few bucks before making it big, but you\'ll have to look quickly. And let\'s not forget Jim\'s backstage ode to Frederich Nietzsche as he pounds on a piano and recites a funny libretto about Nietzsche\'s life. And the video ends with The Doors performing The Soft Parade, which sounds almost too pretty for Jim Morrison to be singing until he takes it to the next level and makes it a ROCK song.One little shortcoming is that The Unknown Soldier is included in the Dance On Fire section and in The Soft Parade section and is essentially the same video and makes it a bit of a redundancy.A really weird thing about this DVD is that the menu doesn\'t appear until the end of the videos, but it does have a slew of bonus features that an avid Doors fan or a growing fan will want to see. The most prominent among these are Ray\'s films Evergreen, and Induction, which are very Godardesque films he made while at the UCLA film school. Induction features a party scene and if you look quickly you can see Jim Morrison as an extra in the scene.The bonus features also has the almost obligatory audio commentary which really doesn\'t add anything to the viewing of the videos. Ray can be pretentious at times, and Robby and John seem along for the ride. Although, Ray and John also have their own special features about a 10 minute clip from Densmore\'s one man play Riders On The Storm, and Robby presents a reworked instrumental of The End which sounds more Emerson, Lake, & Palmer. And Henry Diltz offers rarely seen pictures from the Morrison Hotel photo shoot with a five minute commentary.You really can\'t lose with this DVD.

It also contains a feature entitled \\"Bambi: Inside Walt\'s Story Meetings\\" where we are able to listen to the comments of those involved in making the film.  It also contains a preview of the second disk.The second DVD is packed with extras as is the case with all of the Platinum Editions.  It includes a couple of deleted scenes (Winter Grass, and Bambi\'s First Snow), some games and activities for the younger viewers, and a lot of behind the scenes features as well, called Backstage Disney.  These include a making of feature, a restoration features, a sneak peak at the new Bambi movie, a time capsule for 1942, a feature on the multi-plane camera, a feature on the Disney archives, \\"The Old Mill\\" animated short (in which many of the techniques that were used in \\"Bambi\\" would be tried), the original trailer, and artwork from the movie.It has been said that \\"Bambi\\" is the animated feature with the fewest lines of dialogue, and it is amazing how they combined movement and music to effectively tell the story while keeping the dialogue to a minimum.  The movie also is known for its very stylistic or impressionistic backgrounds.  Lastly, as far as I know this is the only Disney movie where the main villain (Man) never appears on the screen.  Instead we see and hear the tools of man, such as gunshots, his hunting dogs, and his campfire which gets out of control and starts a forest fire.The movie was based on the 1923 book of the same name by Felix Salten, although I think it is safe to say that most people now think of the movie when they hear the name.  It premiered in London on August 8th of 1942, in the midst of World War II.  It was the only civilian project which Disney continued during the war years.  The rest of the studio was dedicated to helping the war effort.  Not surprisingly, given the circumstances, the movie lost money in its initial release but has subsequently made millions for the company.The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1943, including Best Music, Original Song (Frank Churchill & Larry Morey), Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Frank Churchill & Edward H. Plum), and for Best Sound, Recording (C. O. Slyfield).  In 1948 it won a special Golden Globe award for Walt Disney for futhering the influence of the screen with the Hindustani version of the movie.

What the film gets right, it gets spectacularly right. Animation is, indeed, the best medium to capture the magical aspects of the story. The sequence where Peter Pan, Wendy, John, and Michael fly from London to Never-Land is stunning. It is almost immediately apparent why \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the finest Disney films of the 1950\'s. The film gains much of its appeal from the excellent vocal performances of Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan), Hans Conreid (Mr. Darling and Captain Hook), Kathryn Beaumount, (Wendy) and Bill Thompson (Mr. Smee). The story has plenty of action and adventure, and moves along at a brisk pace. The depiction of the Indians as caricatures instead of characters is painfully, politically incorrect. But one must remember the era in which this film was made. It would be decades before Cathy Rigby\'s stage revival of \\"Peter Pan\\" would correct this sticky situation. But, as the stage and animated films are completely different mediums, the point is moot.The Disney version of \\"Peter Pan\\" is an artistic triumph. It is often delightful, but it is only about fun and games in Never-Land. While Disney captured the magic and fantasy brilliantly, he never grasped the darker, psychologically complex aspects of the story. The Disney version captures Peter Pan  as the spirit of youth, joy, and freedom, but lacks the emotional depth of Barrie\'s original story. The great villain Captain Hook clearly represents the \\"adult, father figure\\" who must be destroyed because he\'s a threat to all the fun and games. There\'s no romantic tension between Peter Pan and Wendy. There is no acknowledgement of Peter\'s lonliness or the things he will never have. At the end of Barrie\'s play, Peter Pan returns to the nursery and discovers Wendy is now a grown-up adult. Disney completely ignored Barrie\'s ending, and all of its bittersweet implications.The DVD features an excellent audio commentary by the late Roy Disney, (Walt\'s nephew), film critic Leonard Maltin, several of the animators, Margaret Kerry (the model for the hot-tempered, jealous pixie Tinker Bell), Kathryn Beaumount-- and even some surprising comments from Walt Disney himself. The short featurette \\"The Making Of Peter Pan\\" and the longer documentary \\"The Peter Pan That Almost Was\\", are especially informative and entertaining.The brief life of Bobby Driscoll, more tragic than magic, is a sad footnote to \\"Peter Pan.\\" Driscoll, who received a special Academy Award for his role in  the suspense-thriller \\"The Window\\",  made immeasurable contributions to the success of Disney\'s \\"Song Of The South\\", \\"So Dear To My Heart\\", \\"Treasure Island\\" and \\"Peter Pan.\\" After his Disney contract was dropped (the same month, incidentally, that \\"Peter Pan\\" was released), Driscoll descended into drug addiction and spent some time in prison. Driscoll died in 1968, alone and peniless, at the age of 31. Of his movie career, Driscoll remarked, \\"I was carried on a satin pillow... and then dumped into the garbage.\\" Magic and happiness, it often seems, exist only in the movies.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "THE GOLDEN ERA OF DISNEY ANIMATION: \\"PETER PAN\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1282867200, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2010"}\n',

The film looks really good and the only thing that gives away the fact that it wasn\'t filmed yesterday is the color palette.The DVD set comes in a collector\'s box with faux leather-suede fringe and an iron on \\"Woodstock\\" patch that you peel off the box. The DVDs are housed in 3 cardboard sleeves that are laminated on the sides that come in contact with the DVDs. I read that one reviewer found all of the DVDs were scratched on the playable sides, but luckily mine were fine.WOODSTOCK was a three-day concert featuring some of the hottest rock bands of that era (some that would become legendary from that concert) that took place in 1969 on a farm in Bethel, NY. It drew an estimated crowd of over 400,000 people of all races, ages, and classes. Even though so many things went wrong like not having enough food or water, or even proper bathroom or lodgings for the crowd, it was a peaceful event. Woodstock showed the world that music and people (mostly young) could come together and be with each other in peace, harmony and love, and really look out for one another.The film not only documents this happening beautifully, but it puts the viewer right in the middle of the action not only on stage but in the crowd, too. Truly worth seeing to know what the hype was all about.*** DVDs 1 & 2 *** This is the movie ***These two DVDs contain the director\'s cut of the documentary and a special featurette taking viewers on a tour of the Woodstock museum at Bethel Woods dedicated to preserving the Woodstock experience.*** DVD 3 *** This is the EXTRAS DVD ***====  02:27:00 (hour:minute:second) with \\"play all\\" or \\"scene selection\\"Additional performances not seen in the film. The Grateful Dead must have been blitzed \'cause they jam for like 40-minutes on one song! I read about their legendary performances--where they go on for hours--but this time I got to witness it! There\'s also great additional footage of people arriving for the concert, the closing end of the festival, and a commercial for the art and music fair during this segment.====  01:16:52 (h:m:s) again with \\"p/a\\" or \\"s/s\\" [22-featurettes in all]This segment chronicles the making of the festival from concert to movie with interviews done in the present with people like director Michael Wadleigh and associate producer Dale Bell. Also included are some musicians, behind the scenes people, Martin Scorsese who was an assistant director/editor at the time, and the executive producer Michael Lang who was featured in the movie riding his motor bike to and fro, trying to get things off the ground.I really enjoyed these featurettes because they give you an inside view on all of the obstacles that went on behind the scenes of this fabled concert and how it all came together in the eleventh hour. The last segment is an excerpt from Playboy\'s show \\"After Dark\\" where Hugh Hefner interviews Wadleigh on that show. Hefner introduces the segment.*** DVD 3 *** This is the AMAZON BONUS DVD ***====  00:10:17 (h:m:s)More never before seen performances though it only runs a paltry 10-minutes.====  00:10:58Three more featurettes dealing with behind the scenes stuff, but again just shy of 11-minutes.

The Jefferson Airplane and Carlos Santana, surprisingly.

As a child of the sixties, and someone involved in all of the activities and social issues described herein, I find myself once again amazed whenever I catch this on TV, usually late at night.  For through the space of this seemingly endless concert film are the continuing threaded elements of a very important story, the epic tale of how a separate and distinct subculture in attempted to stand amidst the blaring hostile spotlights of an overbearing and dominating mainstream culture.The parts of the movie I love watching best are not of the performers, but rather are the threads connecting them, the bits and pieces of extraneous events, conversations, and interactions that helped to flesh out the details of exactly what the social ethos of the counterculture were, and how they would inform, describe, and detail its members.  The first few minutes of the film, consisting of long and cinematically gorgeous shots of young \\"freaks\\" congregating to build the sound stage for the concert in an overgrown glen in upstate New York on tractors, horses, and in trucks and cars is breath-taking, and sets the stage for the kind of laid-back presentation that follows.It is difficult to explain or to articulate what Woodstock meant, both to those of us who were lucky enough to be there and to the rest of us who experienced only vicariously through the countless stories and tales that emanated from it afterward, and from documentary evidence such as is provided by this film, that the so-called youth culture existed and thrived, by at least some 500,000 and most likely by many, many more freaks than that. For in truth reality was the coming of age of the youth movement in the same moment it became its funeral dirge, for the dominating mainstream culture recognized both its threat and its opportunity for them, in cultural and commercial terms, and the elements of the youth culture was quickly co-opted by advertising and business. Yet for all of that, what we had was a wonderful moment, however brief, in the warmth of togetherness in the sun. Watch the movie and celebrate.

The music in the movie was very good. The on the scene footage was also well shot. You were able to see Woodstock from every perspectivein this movie.

It was good to see the performances of CCR and a few others not previously seen.  It made me appreciate the camera work and editing done on the actual movie performances, because the bonus footage was just standard footage and not nearly as interesting from a visual perspective.  I wanted to see the footage of the Grateful Dead and then understood why I hadn\'t seen it before.  It was a lackluster performance and the lighting was terrible, because the festival producers were not catering to the needs of the film crew.  Based on the extra footage provided I thought the set was way overpriced.  They tried to justify the high cost by including a lot of unnecessary packaging and nicknacks that didn\'t add much real value.  They even included a little Woodstock tambourine, which is not something I would have paid for.  I would say just buy the director\'s cut.  Most of the additional performances are available on Youtube.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ultimate Collector\'s Edition not worth the added expense", "unixReviewTime": 1385856000, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2013"}\n',

So here it goes:PROS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:1. The picture and sound quality have never looked or sounded better!2. Great bonus disc with many great, ROCKING, unreleased performances!3. Amazon offers a second bonus disc with three more performances!4. The extra features on all three discs are informative about the festival!5. The package design is inventive and fun! The Life magazine reprint is awesome!CONS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:1. Not too crazy about the \\"boxing\\" on the full screen sections of the film!2. THERE WAS 100% NO NEED FOR A LOUSY 30+ MINUTE JAM FROM THE GRATEFUL DEAD!  I love The Dead, but this is just a freaking bore!3. No extras of Janis, Sly, Ten Years After, Arlo Guthrie, and no first time seen performances of Bert Sommer, Quill, Incredible String Band, or The Band.4. The Amazon and Target exclusive bonus discs contain two separate sets of performances.5. I WANNA SEE MORE SHA NA NA!So there ya go!

Jefferson Airplane are beyond awful, and Canned Heat are quite dire - I don\'t know what Henry Vestine was on but his guitar is out of time, out of tune and out of it completely. Some acts managed to get it together, such as the Who, Santana, and even Country Joe and the Fish (nice, if out of tune, guitar from Barry Melton) and it is easy to see why dear old Alvin Lee in 10 Years After was such a hit - coming from a country that boasted Peter Green, Jeff Beck, Clapton, Rory Gallagher, Jimmy Page, Kim Simmons, Mick Green and many others, it was the norm to be very good and to play very well. Excellence was expected and the British Blues Scene led the world. Muddy, BB King and many others have paid tribute to the Stones, the Beatles, Clapton, Green and all the others for making sure that anybody who isn\'t from the planet Zark knows who Robert Johnson is.If you had to sum the whole thing up, I suppose that the performances by CSN and Ritchie Havens sum it up pretty well musically - lots of flailing at acoustic guitars and sweet vocals. And Hendrix ... well, Hendrix. I blow very hot and cold about Sir Jimi, and I am cold about this performance too. Thank goodness somebody else has had the courage to say that he was not actually that good. In 1968, at the Woburn Abbey Festival, I saw a dreadful performance from Hendrix, and I mean dreadful, when he was completely upstaged by a 20-year-old Rory Gallagher with a primitive version of Taste. And here they are again, a year after Woodstock, at the Isle of Wight Festival, and those who were there told me at the time that the absolute show-stoppers were Procol Harum (don\'t laugh - they had Robin Trower, BJ Wilson and Gary Brooker)and ... Rory Gallagher with Taste. Luckily we have \\"Taste At The Isle Of Wight\\" available so you can judge for yourselves..... but that great Deceiver, Memory, has put Saint Jimi forward as the star of the IOW show.Anyway, as a social document it is fascinating, lots of Peace and Love and rolling in the mud. But like all dreams it had to stop, and what this self-contained village (supported by food drops and an army of social and medical volunteers) left behind was a bloody awful mess, an emerging account of some very threatening back-stage scenes and an acreage \\"ankle deep in human s***\\", as one American (called Berry - where else?) who was there told me. It reminds me of the Travellers, who want to be \\"left alone\\" and not \\"victimised\\" - as long as some silly bu**er in full-time work is prepared to pick up the tab, hand over the dole, pay for the schooling, pay for the medical needs, pay for everything in fact. I know that\'s a bit cynical, because there really was a soft feeling to the 60s and early 70s, but there was also a buzz of anger and violence. Perhaps you had to live through Nixon, Vietnam and the Hell\'s Angels to really get the point of Woodstock. Perhaps not.Buy? Yes, I guess so, because there are good parts musically and socially, and it surely won\'t happen again. But FF the dreadful bands - there\'s a lot of them, too - almost all from the U S of A.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Either the end or the beginning of a dream...", "unixReviewTime": 1178496000, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2007"}\n'
