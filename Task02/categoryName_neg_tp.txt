Cruelty shown in this movie would damage their psyche.Since this movie was devoted to the last 12 hours of Jesus\' life, I was surprised that it didn\'t mentioned Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Jew (and a secret disciple of Jesus) who begged Pontius Pilate to release Jesus\' body to him for proper burial after his death.  It was Joseph of Arimathea who wrapped Jesus\' body in the finest cloth and laid him in his own family\'s tomb, a man-made cave in his garden.

The acting is quite good and as a history freak I found it interesting to hear Latin and Aramaic. I did not find it anti-semitic, but then I can understand why Jewish folk might be suspicious, given the beliefs espoused by Gibsons\' family, and never actually disavowed by Gibson himself.I am not a Christian, so it struck me as odd that Christians would like this film from a theological standpoint. Perhaps I am just not getting it. I always understood that the most central point of the Jesus story was that he arose from the dead, not that he was tortured to death. So it suprises me that the film would concentrate almost entirely on this one aspect of the story, rather than on the resurrection part. That it does not, smacks of violence-as-a-marketing-tool to me. When all the hoopla has died down, it will be interesting to see how much money Gibson will have made off of the suffering of his savior.I have to say that I am more than a little shocked at the fawning tone I have seen in these reviews, particularly from Christians. The enthusiastic way in which they are taking joy in watching someone being slowly tortured to death is sickening; and exactly the same sort of bloodthirsty eagerness that the ancient Romans displayed when they watched animals and people (including Christians) being executed in the arena. The fact that there is a religious purpose to the film does not excuse this. I wonder if this movie were made with the exact same types of scenes, but without the religious content, how many of reviewers would still sing its praises.

I went twice to watch it in theaters and was appalled by the \\"audience\\" awaiting admittance. The first time, I was walking from the parking lot to the box office when a small bus pulled up and a church Sunday school group that included roughly a dozen small children (ages 5 to maybe 8 roughly)hopped out with chaperones. I got in line behind them and listened to the adults talking about the number of times they had each seen the film and how much they were looking forward to discussing it with the children afterwards. Having been previously advised from numerous places of the \\"realism\\" of the torture sequences and crucifixion, I decided the greater \\"horror\\" for me would be in seeing these small children react to the supposedly graphic violence. I simply walked back to my car and went home. The second time (a few weeks later after the initial \\"rush\\" of people going to a new movie had died down a bit)I actually managed to purchase a ticket and was waiting in the lobby for the previous screening to let out. A few minutes later, the doors opened and the crowd began shuffling out. Once again there were several families with small children. While the parents attempted to masquerade their emotional reactions by blinking and talking about how the sudden bright sunlight was \\"tearing\\" them up, the children weren\'t old enough to be embarrassed about showing feelings in public. Most were openly sobbing, all had red eyes, and one small girl (perhaps 4 or 5 years old at most) was shaking so badly that her dad had to pick her up, console her, and carry her outside. Once again, I was so upset and angry I had to leave.Now that I\'ve seen it with my own eyes I can see why those kids were so freaked out.Although I don\'t belong to one of the most commonly known denominations, I am a Christian. I am also a daily reader of the scriptures, and have lectured on biblical scripture and prophecy all over the Eastern U.S. in churches and seminaries, as well as on college campuses. In other words, while I wouldn\'t define myself as an expert on all things God, I\'m a bit more spiritually \\"seasoned\\" than most laypeople.The life of Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Bible, is centered around the final 3 years of his earthly life. His birth is depicted - especially in regards to the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and Jewish traditions - and there is a brief mention of his youth in the book of Luke. There are literally dozens of events during the 3 years of Christ\'s earthly mission that are filmworthy. In fact, the sheer number of films made about his life stand as proof of that fact. Did the world truly need a story that not only focuses primarily on Jesus\' final week, but uses every means of modern effects to splatter gore and depict the massive agony endured by the Son of God? Maybe I\'m in the minority (apparently, I should say) but I don\'t need to watch Jesus writhe and scream with each strike of the lash in order to respect and understand the sacrifice such suffering represented. I didn\'t need to personally witness the nails being driven in, the biblical depiction sufficed. The Glory of Christ\'s sacrifice is not found in his willingness to endure pain and death in God\'s name. Literally hundreds of millions of ordinary people have done that before Christ\'s birth as well as after. The Glory of Christ is found in the Word of God that came from his lips and the power of the Holy Spirit that transformed the entirety of humankind.We are asked to live the message and believe in Christ\'s name. We are not required to bear witness to the atrocities committed to his human vessel.But most important of all, I deeply believe that forcing or allowing small children to endure the trauma of watching the torture and murder of someone they have been taught to love above all others is not only unnecessary, but borders on abuse. Learning of the Passion from the Bible or from suitable talks with parents, clergy, and Sunday school teachers should be enough education for a small child to understand that God loves them and that Jesus can live within their hearts.Mel Gibson may have had the best intentions (my right to judge ends at the tip of my own nose) but I am of the opinion that the end result represents a massive and grotesque misjudgement.Feel free to slam this review if that is your wont.

Being moved by the images, drama, music, and graphic violence of an R rated movie is different than being moved by the gospel.  I want to go on record as a Christian leader who does not share the enthusiasm.  The film\'s producer, Mel Gibson, is a devout Roman Catholic, and as a devout Protestant I cannot share his passion for this project, for several reasons:1. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MESSAGEa) A distorted message.Despite its claims about authenticity and accuracy, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" does not replicate the gospel accounts, but presents a distorted view of the gospels influenced by Gibson\'s Roman Catholic background.  Gibson has supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich\'s \\"The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\\")  This is plainly evident in the prominent portrayal of Mary, and the link between the cross and the altar of the mass - important themes peculiar to Roman Catholic theology.  The gospel according to Mel is not the same as the gospel according to Matthew.b) An incomplete message.Secular viewers cannot be expected to understand what they\'re seeing without a fuller proclamation of the doctrine of sin and salvation.  Little wonder that many non-Christian viewers left the theatre confused.  Is this any surprise?  The Ethiopian eunuch described in Acts 8 had the same reaction when he read about Christ\'s suffering in Isaiah 53.  When asked \\"Do you understand what you are reading?\\" he answered \\"How can I, unless someone explains it to me?\\"  A cinematic version of Christ\'s suffering is in itself incomplete without the preaching of the gospel and a call to faith.  It shows *how* Jesus died, but not *why* He died.  Without someone explaining it, is it any wonder that unbelieving viewers do not understand what they are seeing?  Instead of leaving the cinema as new converts, many non-Christians left disgusted at the graphic violence (which many attest is worse than they\'ve seen in any secular movies), convinced the movie was more bloody than spiritual, and questioning the credibility of Christians who normally abhor Hollywood\'s violence.2. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MEDIUMAside from the fact that the movie\'s doctrinal content is questionable, the whole notion of turning the Bible into film form is seriously suspect. It is not only the message that is influenced by Roman Catholic theology, but also the medium.a) Presenting the gospel in film *can* not be done.A movie about Christ\'s life inevitably includes significant speculation and fiction, and even the best attempts to be \\"authentic\\" will ultimately be a distortion of the Bible. What makes Christ\'s suffering unique is that it was accompanied by a sense of God\'s wrath and curse which sinners deserve.  A film might attempt to portray the horror of physical suffering and torture, but it cannot do justice to the spiritual aspect of being cursed by God, which the Bible highlights as the most significant aspect of Christ\'s suffering.  Translating the gospels into film and doing full justice to God\'s revelation in the Bible is impossible.b) Presenting the gospel in film *may* not be done.Sola Scriptura (by Scripture alone) is a basic Biblical principle defended by Protestant Churches with their roots in the Reformation.  It is echoed in many of their confessional documents, such as Lord\'s Day 35 of the Heidelberg Catechism in connection with the second commandment: God \\"wants His people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of His Word.\\" We should not be wiser than God. The means that the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God\'s Word, along with the sacraments. Translating the Bible narratives about Christ into the visual images of film ultimately suggests an insufficiency in the Word and Sacraments, and at bottom tries to cater to man\'s natural curiosity and dissatisfaction with the written Word! Christians should not be surprised to find themselves curious about how this film presents Christ\'s life, since sinful hearts are naturally not content with limiting themselves to God\'s revelation and His official means of grace.  Such fascination is precisely the reason for the appeal of all violations of the second commandment. We must however limit ourselves to the official means of grace that the most wise God has ordained to be the food of our soul: the audible preaching and the visible sacraments.Many Christians who are enthusiastic about this movie may be disappointed at my lack of enthusiasm for a project that purports to honour Christ.  But being Biblical is more than just about getting the message right, it\'s about getting the medium right too. Noble ambitions do not justify the use of methods that are not pleasing to God.  It\'s surprising that Protestants would uncritically accept a movie that in principle is the contemporary equivalent of a Roman Catholic stained glass window, a cinematic \\"image\\" used in addition to the Bible to teach people the gospel.  Is the Bible really so deficient that we need this?  This is an opportunity to renew a passion for the Word - read and preached - which reveals the living Christ. Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ\'s suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel.  If you are looking for greater insight into Christ\'s passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don\'t watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLY", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don\'t watch the movie, but read the Book!", "unixReviewTime": 1092787200, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2004"}\n',

Although Christ (Jim Caviezel) is shown to have healing powers, the Jewish leaders see him as a trouble-maker and turn him over to the Roman authorities on contrived charges of treason against Caesar. An oft-told story, it is Gibson\'s vision to focus on the horrific suffering Christ endured on the day of his crucifixion.Since religion has always been an impassioned issue liable to start wars, the needless controversy surrounding this picture arose before principal shooting had begun. The majority of the film\'s Jewish characters, caught up in mob mentality, are portrayed as self-righteous and uncaring. The Romans fare worse, with most of them behaving like bloodthirsty boors. Yet, history cannot be rewritten to placate sensitive individuals. If anyone today proclaimed themself a Messiah, would we not condemn him in exactly the same manner?Sadly, the trite screenplay (co-written by Gibson) assumes we know the antagonists\' motivation, and barely touches upon Jesus\' teachings of love and forgiveness. It chooses instead to glorify the barbaric atrocities of our race in lengthy scenes of blood-drenched torture.As the copper-eyed prophet, the usually engaging Caviezel has little to do but gasp in pain, while the two Marys drift through the draining story in tears. Pontius Pilate is depicted as a reluctant judge and Herod a fop, while the sporadic appearance of a female but deep-voiced Satan seems peculiar and out of place.Gibson also co-produced the film, which was lensed in southern Italy because of its resemblance to ancient Israel. The stained teeth and coarse clothing give the film convincing period detail, but the visuals are drab and without colour. The entire movie is also spoken in the acerbic Aramaic language and accordingly subtitled. This proves to be only mildly distracting -- the rhythmic score and too-frequent sound effects of twittering birds are far more annoying.Like Michael Cimino\'s infamous Heaven\'s Gate, The Passion of the Christ will prove to be Gibson\'s artistic folly. It lacks the beauty and marvel of past biblical epics, offering no entertainment or educational value. Further, there are far too many slow-motion sequences that merely accentuate the slow-moving narrative. If those opposed would simply ignore rather than protest, the film would come and go soon enough.

I admire Mel Gibson as a person, particularly for sticking to his religious beliefs so well in the secular Hollywood.  But, no matter how much I like and respect the man, I cannot possibly bring myself to like this movie.I had to see this movie for my Confirmation class, so a friend and I went together.  As I said, I have been in Catholic school all of my life.  I have studied the medical process of Crucifixion in-depth.  Due to movies, and plays, and Stations of the Cross, I have seen Jesus brutally killed over one hundred different times.  I basically could stage my own Jesus crucifixion if I really wanted, I know what happens so well.  So I will admit I was only anxious to see the movie for the controversial supposed anti-Semitic undertone (I was wondering if it was true; I found none personally)... and Aramaic, which is a sweet language.How do I put this nicely.  Even when Jesus is being arrested, the unnecessary, non-scriptured violence already is beginning. They push him off of a cliff and he just dangles there!  I almost burst out laughing, it was so ridiculous.  Then there\'s the symbolism.  Oh my heavens, the symbolism.  It was like The Great Gatsby, the movie, only without the awesome characters, story, and the symbolism was incredibly forced.  Some of it was just gross too.  I\'ll get more into that later.Let\'s not forget the whipping scene... I sat through some of it, went to the bathroom, and then came back and they hadn\'t even finished with the first weapon!  I am pretty sure that the scripture clearly states that Jesus was whipped 39 times, but, whatever.  I wish that it had been done in like Jesus Christ Superstar with the guitar riff, so at least I could have enjoyed good music.  By the way, The Passion\'s music sucks.  It\'s similar to Troy, tries so hard to be disturbing and anguished but just ends up being a grating caterwhaul.There are some very beautiful scenes in the movie, don\'t get me wrong, ones that almost made me cry.  These are the non-violent ones, where we flash back to Jesus\' life and teachings and stuff that doesn\'t involve him being covered with blood.  But they are too short-lived.  For example, I\'ve always found one of the most beautiful parts of the Crucifixion to be the part with the good thief.  In the movie, it promises to have that same beauty, and I was awestruck for a moment... then the movie remembered \\"Oh yeah, I\'m supposed to be grossing people out\\" and the bad thief got his eye pecked out by a bird.  I kid you not. Therefore, these short, beautiful scenes are too few and far between to redeem the movie, though it\'s a shame because they were very well-done.The movie gets you so accustomed to blood that by the time when Jesus is basically all blood and no flesh, you\'re just \\"...eh.\\"  It desensitizes you.  I was grossed out at first, then I grew used to it.  It also gives you two very pretty people to look at so you\'re not too offended (Mary Magdelen and the Apostle John)  Just when you think Jesus can\'t bleed anymore, he does.Also, the lack of accuracy drove me nuts because the whole point of the movie was to be accurate... that\'s even why they put it in Aramaic!  For instance, Jesus carried the entire cross and the nails were through his hands.  These have been proven to not be true; the wrists would have been pierced, and he would have just carried the horizontal part of the cross.  Like I said, I wouldn\'t have cared as much if Gibson hadn\'t been so proud of his accurate portrayal.  Then again, my medical student brother-in-law told me that no one can bleed that much and survive, so maybe I am giving this movie too much credit.  It figures.I was NOT religiously touched nor enlightened; is there any person out there who thought that crucifixion was a walk in the park?  If anything, the movie\'s total attitude was so stifling and had so much self-grandeur that I had to keep from laughing at times.  I mean, it was completely ludicrous.When I went to Confirmation class to discuss the movie with my fellow catechumists, I found that I was not alone. Our catechist was very surprised to see that all of us had hated the movie and none of us were at all touched.  A guy from my school summed up how we all felt: \\"They didn\'t tell us anything about Jesus.  It was like watching a stranger get killed.\\"  I think that\'s a good way of putting it.  I didn\'t feel like the person getting maimed was my Lord and Savior.  I mean, lots of people were crucified.  I need to see a little more than that.Frankly, it scares me that there are people who bought this movie and will be watching it more than once.  To me, it is hollow and I get more out of hearing the Passion read at Palm Sunday mass, or attending the Holy Week masses like the Easter Vigil, or even listening to Jesus Christ Superstar, which is what I like to do every Good Friday.

I\'m guessing the answer is no.  As for Smell Gibson, I think he needs to stop taking himself so seriously and let somebody else have a crack at it.  This is really just a B movie that you seem to walk into the middle of.  Why no teachings of Jesus?  Why no childhood of Jesus?  Because, my friend, that simply is not good box office.

Jesus said, \\"you cannot follow both me and money.\\"  And yet here we see multimillionaire Smell Gibson coming on all pious.  Jesus said, \\"Resist not evil.\\"  And he walked his talk by getting crucified.  Again, highly inconvenient teachings.  Gee, what to do... uhhh, how about we just pick and choose what we like the sound of and then sort of bandy that stuff around while we collect brownie points for going to church and sitting there like a bump on a log?  Looks like we\'re all set.Addition 9-10-04:  Consider also, the title of the film.  The Passion of The Christ.  This phraseology is inescapably vulgar.  First, I believe one is supposed to get the wrong idea: \\"Yeah, Christ sure was passionate.\\"  Or, better yet, \\"Gee, I didn\'t know that Jesus got lucky.  Is this a French film?\\"  Joe Six Pack is supposed to go wandering inno the theater expecting a stag reel.  But lets say the audience gets wised up and then no longer expects a stag film - like right about the time they\'re driving the nails through his palms.

Lunde", "helpful": [12, 27], "reviewText": "I waited a while to see The Passion of the Christ so that I could approach it fairly and without the shouting of the faithfull/unfaithfull clogging up my ears. Recently, I was amazed to read Roger Ebert\'s 4-star review, which stated it was a great film simply because Ebert believed in what he was seeing and the film depicted that. So, I got it, saw it, and, . . .not so fast Mr. Ebert.Let me take this thing apart from several angles. For production, the film was nicely shot and adequate, and overall, the shots of Jerusalem type surroundings were effective. But the entire film was very cramped, and the only drammatic sequences that worked well for me were the scenes with Pontious Pilate. The film uses a  broad brush of color and myst; this reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings, and I half expected Frodo and Golom to appear at any time. Its constant use of slow motion to accentuate the beatings and whippings was very distracting, and the usual heavenly music competed with memories of The Ten Commandments. From these perspectives, Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Heaven was a powerful and beautiful film, which also gave the city a memorable singularity and grace. I also rewatched Barrabas, an earlier epic that more creatively and poignantly tells and shows this story, and at least, with more interest.As Jesus, James Caviezel has a handsome and photogenic face; kind of a Charlton Heston replacement with chiseled, monumental features. (He was marvelous in The Thin Red Line.) He looks like those Jesus pictures that people expect to see in a minister\'s office. In this film, however, Caviezel is constantly looking either very focused and silent or very confused and silent. He says little, but apparently this means a lot. When he gets whipped and beaten, which is often, it hurts, and he shows it, as most of us would. When I sum up the character in total, however, I am left with a rather empty shell of a portrayal. For those who know this story, explanations aren\'t necessary, and this is all Gibson gives the viewer. All the other characters, including the Romans, fall into stereotypical grieving, brave Mary, hysterically grinning, laughing, and ponderoulsly cruel Romans, cunning and slithering Jewish prelates, mournfully sad looking apostles, and a devil who looks suspiciously like Marilyn Manson (with snakes). Only Judas and Pontious Pilate have particlular roles that intrigue and question, but Gibson is too in love with the blood of Jesus and the leering of others to let them have much screen time. I wasn\'t left with any conviction that these people were real or that the event was any more worthy than the millions murdered over the millenia.The script was written for the faithful. What does this mean? If you go into most medieval churches in Europe, you sill see the renditions of the Christ story by the great painting masters of their time; you see the suffering of Christ, the crucifiction of Christ, Christ carrying the cross, the Resurrection of Christ, and so on. This film is merely a modern extension of those themes, and nothing else. I wanted to come away from this film with a new feeling, an insight into this story, which is entirely based on belief and with no archeology or record to support it. Pasolini\'s St. Matthew film portrays a believable Jesus, Barrabas gives us an intellectual and epic story of a man\'s journey to belief, and even M. Scorcese\'s film asks questions about the life of Jesus. None of this is in this film, just blood, more blood, flayed flesh, and more blood.

After all, I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was. Unfortunately graphic violence alone isn\'t enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is. For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary. All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot. In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me. I couldn\'t help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood (based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged) and the beatings he took about the head, that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain. The few, brief scenes which didn\'t involve Jesus\' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion. These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with, and the dull, monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life. The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly. How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth.

If you can\'t get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise, charismatic, and loving entity Jesus was.

Walker \\"catu11us\\"", "helpful": [8, 22], "reviewText": "Let us surmise that in the heady early days of the Third (or Temporary) Reich, Herr Doktor Gobbles commissioned ... um ooops ... Doktor Goebbels commissioned a film the purpose of which would be to discredit Christianity.  Let us further surmise that the result was a film called \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".  Given these results, the filmmaker would have been awarded German filmdom\'s highest award, the Adolf, plus a special thorn cluster authorized by Herr Doktor Goebbels.  That was then.This is now.  And here it is at last:  a new technologically advanced edition of the world\'s slimiest \\"Bible\\" travesty in all its Gospel-bashing, anti-Semitic, and fantasy-pushing glory.Aside from its propagandistic purposes, \\"Passion\\" is so full of inaccuracies, it\'s hard to know where to start.  Let\'s start by noting that the only historically worthwhile (if not necessarily accurate) narratives we have of the so-called \\"passion\\" are the 4 canonical gospels.  Nothing else of a non-scholarly nature is worth the paper it\'s printed on.  This film depends on apocryphal (and useless) narratives, the ravings of a 19th-Century hysteric nun, and other fraudulent \\"sources\\".  In addition there are other solecisms of a purely stupid nature.For instance, Gibson thinks he\'s really clever by having people speak the languages they would have spoken at the time.  And then, laughably, he has Jesus and Pilate conversing in Latin.  Latin was not the lingua franca of the Roman East ... that was Greek.  Furthermore, Jesus was born (at Bethlehem-in-Galilee, not Bethlehem-in-Judea) and raised in Galilee, an area which was under the Hebrew- and Greek-speaking rule of various Herods.  Jesus and Pilate would have spoken in Greek.  (The argument that Jesus would have learned Latin from Roman soldiers is just silly ... Galilee was part of an autonomous kingdom and Roman soldiers didn\'t enter the area until after the exile of Herod Antipas in 39 CE.  Besides, the Roman military spoke a patois of Italic - related to Latin - that was widely used in northern Italy.)Gibson\'s contempt for the canonical gospels is a main theme of the film.  In Gethsemane, Jesus is shown not so much praying to his god but having a conversation with Satan - something the gospel writers seem totally unaware of.  Later on, the soldiers that arrest Jesus throw him bodily from a bridge - an event utterly absent from the gospels.The events between Jesus\' arrest and his crucifixion show not only Gibson\'s contempt for the gospels, but also his utter ignorance of the practices of Roman law and the evidence of archaeology.  The bit covering his appearance before the Sanhedrin is hilarious.  The charge - the only charge - was actually a term totally misused these days, \\"blasphemy\\".  That is, in the Greek, \\"blasphemia\\", which means treason, in the sense that Jesus has claimed to be King of Judea.  Despite pathetic attempts by Christians, from the First Century CE on, to give this term a religious connotation, it is a political crime, pure and simple.  Gibson\'s failure to recognize this fact is stupid - as is everything else in this film.The scourging of Jesus is a good example of Gibson\'s contempt for facts.  Roman judicial procedure is well known and the gospels in fact do a fair job of showing it correctly.  Gibson\'s version is not only inaccurate, it\'s trashy.  The pronouncing of sentence of crucifixion ends with this sentence:  \\"Let him be scourged.\\"  No person to be tried before a Roman court was whipped until that sentence was uttered.Furthermore, the whip shown in this film wasn\'t the one used in these cases - it was employed by Gibson solely for its shock value, not in any interest of accuracy.  The actual whip (Latin: flagellum) consisted of several strands of leather of varying length, each tied to a small lead ball.  If you believe the Shroud of Turin is any sort of genuine artifact, please note that it is that whip whose marks appear on the back of the individual portrayed in the shroud.  This tool of punishment also appears in archaeological contexts.The number of strokes was limited to a those needed to start a flow of blood - the purpose of scourging being primarily to weaken the victim and shorten his/her time on the cross.  They were delivered by a trained professional.  What Gibson\'s film shows is not only ridiculously excessive but incomprehensibly and improbably brutal.  This portrayal is clearly for salacious shock value and not any concern for truth.  It is at this point (if not before) that the film degenerates into a work of pure fiction.There is, however, more degeneracy to come.  In a scene that occurs nowhere in the gospels nor any other creditable source, Mary is wandering among the pools of blood in the courtyard in which Jesus was scourged.  We\'ll forego questioning how she got past all those guards into a secure area of a Roman fortress.  Then out trundles Mrs. Pilate with an armload of bedsheets or used togas or some such.  She vanishes and Mary begins to mop up all the blood with togas or sheets or whatever.  Say what?  Is she collecting souvenirs?  I can see a framed slice of sheet on a humble wall in Nazareth.  \\"There\'s a toga of actual blood!\\"  What ... you don\'t like the bit about the frame on the wall?  That\'s just as disgusting and stupid as somebody mopping up blood in the first place.  No wonder the gospels ignore the whole silly story in the first place.  Not only is it silly, it\'s a fairy tale insulting to the intelligence of anyone whose cerebrum\'s weight exceeds 1 ounce.Ah, but wherefore Herr Dr. Goebbels\' award of the prestigious thorn cluster?  Well, of course:  the film\'s stunning if subtle anti-Semitism.  We could point to the film\'s zeal in promoting the old canard that the Jews \\"forced\\" a conviction on a Roman governor who in fact would just as soon crucify people as look at them.We can and do point to one of the film\'s most prominent characters - one who actually appears only once, in a brief sentence, in the gospels\' passion narratives.  This character is Satan, the so-called devil, who pops up everywhere in this film.  This character is the most palpable, horrifying manifestation of the film\'s anti-Semitism.  This manifestation takes the form of Satan being cast as a First Century Jew ... right down to the shawl over his head.This libelous identification of Judaism with Christianity\'s evil angel must of course give much schadenfreude to nutters like the Aryan Brotherhood, the American Nazi Party, and others who live only to hate.  Gibson\'s depiction of Satan as an embodiment of Judaism - this nation\'s moral bedrock - is an act of the most desperate bigotry.Considering that \\"Passion\\" is a tissue of lies and misrepresentations, an affront to anyone who values and respects the gospels, and a virtual celluloid hate crime, we would expect Christians everywhere to shun it for the arrant nastiness that it is.  But what do we find?  They are busy declaring this shabby travesty a triumph of their faith.  What does that say of them?

It seems my fears were well-founded. In the Biblical accounts Mary appears only in the book of John where Jesus tells John that Mary is now to be his mother and tells Mary that John is now to be her son. In this movie she is present in almost every scene and her role is elevated far above what the Bible teaches. She is presented as being Jesus\' support and strength during His trials. Many times Jesus falls and is unable to get up, but after looking at His mother He finds the strength to carry on. The disciples all call Mary \\"mother.\\" Mary is shown submitting her will to God\'s, saying \\"so be it\\" as if her consent was necessary. The movie shows Mary as the suffering servant, suffering along with Jesus. This, of course, stems from Gibson\'s Catholic theology and is foreign to the Bible.Emphasis on Jesus\' SufferingThe movie chronicles Jesus\' physical suffering. He is beaten time and time again and each beating is shown with graphic brutality. After two hours of suffering we see only ten or twelve seconds of Jesus\' triumphing over death. There is really no attempt made to humanize Jesus or to display His divinity and power. There is no attempt made to explain that His physical suffering was nothing when compared to the suffering He experienced by being forsaken by God as the full wrath of God for sin was poured out upon Him. One would assume from the movie that the pain He felt was one and the same as His forsakenness.Would this movie look the same if it was made by a Protestant?The answer to this question is unequivocally \\"no!\\" The movie espouses Catholic theology, Mariology and interpretation. It is clear this movie has a strong Catholic bias. The Catholic bias is simply too strong to deny or downplay.ContextThis movie is almost completely free from context. Any serious student of the Bible knows that context is king and studying the Bible outside of its context is dangerous and leads to erroneous beliefs. Though flashbacks provide snippets of context, on the whole this movie shows only the events of the suffering of Jesus. Without context these events can make no sense to people who are not familiar with Jesus\' history. There is no explanation as to why He has to suffer or even what His suffering and death accomplishes.Idolatry?I found it very troublesome that people identify Jim the actor with Jesus. My mind and emotions never made the transition to actually believing that Jim was Jesus. At one time I began to feel emotion as Jesus, nailed to the cross, cried out for God to forgive His murderers. Interestingly, my mind immediately intervened and kept me from seeing Jim as Jesus. I simply could not and ultimately did not want to see the real Jesus in this movie. I could not identify with this human playing my Lord and my Savior. My mind told me that making such a leap would be to succumb to idolatry.The ScriptOn a macro level this movie succeeds in presenting the story of Jesus\' arrest, trial and death. It covers all the major points from the Garden of Gethsemane to Jesus\' death. On a micro level it is a terrible failure. Errors on this level abound and erroneous theology and interpretation is evident in almost every scene. On the macro level it is the gospel, for it simply follows the Biblical outline. On the micro level it is not the Bible and thus not Christianity. The micro level is mysticism, tradition and poor interpretation.Gibson drew heavily from Sister Anne Emmerich\'s devotional book entitled The Dolorous Passion of Christ. Emmerich is known as being a Mystic, Stigmatist, Visionary, and Prophet. She apparently received many visions in which God provided her details about Jesus\' last days that are not contained in the Bible. This extra-Biblical account of Jesus\' suffering provided many of the smaller details in the movie such as Pilate\'s wife providing the cloth to Mary as well as Simon and Jesus linking arms as they held the cross. It also provided inspiration for some of the words Peter spoke, such as his expression of unworthiness before Mary. Most troubling is that it provided many of the words Jesus spoke. A great number of Jesus\' words from the movie are drawn not from the Bible but from Emmerich. The movie makes no attempt to show what was drawn directly from the Bible and what was drawn from extra-Biblical writing. I am reminded of Revelation 22:18 which reads \\"I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\" To add to the Words of the Bible is a grave sin.Reading through The Dolorous Passion of Christ after seeing the movie I was shocked by how closely the script of The Passion of the Christ follows this book. So much of what I assumed was artistic license was actually drawn from supposed extra-Biblical revelation.ConclusionsI found this movie to be very disappointing and disheartening. Though I had read many reviews for and against it, I was convinced when I began to watch that I would be pleasantly surprised. I believed this especially based on the multitudes of Protestant leaders who provided their support for the movie. The list of these men (on one of the Passion Web sites) reads like a who\'s who of Christian leaders and they described the movie as being \\"factually accurate,\\" \\"very accurate [in the details],\\" \\"realistic,\\" \\"biblical,\\" \\"an accurate account,\\" \\"a true representation of Jesus\\" and \\"close to the Scriptures.\\" Alas, it was not to be. Error is abundant to such a degree that I was shocked that so many Protestant pastors and theologians could give it their full, unequivocal approval. How little they must think of Protestant theology to ignore the pervasive Roman Catholic influence in this movie. My greatest disappointment was not in the movie but in the Protestant leaders and theologians who gave it their recommendation. Gibson made a movie that expresses his faith, but his faith is not the Protestant faith. It seems that so many people in the Protestant world simply do not know enough to discern the difference or they just do not care.It sickens me to hear people expressing that this movie brings the gospels to life and expresses the story of Jesus\' suffering in a new and relevant way. I only wish that people would be so enthusiastic about the Bible! God has ordained that the primary means of reaching the world would be through the faithful preaching of His Word. That is not to say that He cannot and will not use other means, but we must guard ourselves against believing that other methods can surpass the Bible. This movie, full of flaws and error, has made me realize even more why God has given us His living, breathing Word as the primary means of reaching the world. Oh how I wish the church would turn to the Bible as they have turned to this movie! How I wish we would feel the same level of excitement for God\'s words to us given in the Scripture. How I wish we would have faith to believe that God can do so much more through the Bible than can ever be done through a movie.I will leave you with this thought: As my wife left the theatre last night she heard a member of a Protestant church say \\"I didn\'t remember the part in the Bible where Mary wipes up Jesus\' blood. That was so beautiful.\\" This movie blurs Catholicism and Protestantism, Bible and Tradition, Scripture and mysticism. This movie is firmly opposed to Biblical Protestantism.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Opposed To Protestantism", "unixReviewTime": 1098057600, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2004"}\n',

But, since I enjoyed \\"Apocalypto\\" in spite of its problems (which any film painting on such a large canvas is likely to have), I finally decided to watch this much-hyped film.  I was appalled.The story of the Passion is relatively brief, but powerful, whether or not you accept its literal truth.  This film reduced its potency to an orgy of sado-masochistic exhibitionism with anti-Semitic embellishments.  \\"Jews\\" are depicted as a faceless, howling mob lusting for sacred blood, some going so far to visit the site of the execution to gloat like comic-opera villains, something Jews of the time would have never done, places of execution being ritually unclean.  Further, the \\"Satan\\" of the Gesthemane scene was equally problematic, a malevolent, androgyne cross between Klaus Nomi and Udo Kier.  Gibson clearly sets his fey and urbane devil against the \\"muscular\\" Christ in what I thought was yet another Gibson indulgence of the tired, emasculated \\"homosexual evil\\" construct. Never mind that Satan, in the actual Passion story, never puts in an appearance.  And these are fairly representative problems in what is, essentially, a two-hour long snuff film where the \\"Sermon on the Mount\\" is reduced to one line, swallowed up by loving, gratuitous shots of Roman punishments and execution methods.  Indeed, if the movie has any value, it lies in a faithful reproduction of how Romans treated people who ran afoul of their rule.  But as is, it takes the clear prejudices of the film-maker, slathers them with gore, and lays them on the flayed back of the unimpressive Jim Caveziel who - I hope - was very well paid for his efforts, at least.If this is a subject that interests you, I would recommend \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\\"  True, it is very long and can get very dry, but at least it tries to be as comprehensive as the historical record allows, and you actually hear the words of Christ as opposed to his shrieks.

The print itself is disgusting, probably more so than anything Power Multimedia have ever released. The colours are under-saturated to the point of looking black and white, the image occasionally warps, the image is abundant with scratches, hairs, tears and other such blemishes. The high amount of artifacting didn\'t help it much either. While trying to be as fair as I can with this review, I honestly can\'t find any redeeming qualities with this release.AUDIO QUALITY:The disc only contains one audio option, the English dub. Although encoded as 5.1, all it is doing is putting the exact same stream through every channel. Basically it\'s mono, which just happens to be coming out of all your speakers. The whole film is plagued with constant hissing and some frequent popping. It\'s not flat out terrible, but it\'s far from \\"good\\".EXTRA FEATURES:Seriously, what did you expect?OVERALL:The first thing I noticed upon opening the Amazon box was the cover, which is printed on standard printer paper. They must have been running low on ink when printing my copy, since it\'s covered with vertical lines. The cover itself wasn\'t cut to fit properly, with odd white borders around the image and stuffed in the case at the wrong angle. The cover art looks very crude, and the name \\"Ghidrah\\" was also misspelled as \\"Ghidra\\". The disc itself has a cheap home made label, and I noticed the ink had smudged around the edges. Upon playing the disc there is a very cheesy splash screen which aids the ego of the mysterious \\"John Matarazzo\\", who also had his name listed as the films director for a short time on Amazon, and credits himself for \\"DVD Design and Creation\\" and \\"Realization\\" on the cover. When I tried booting the disc in my DVD player, no luck - rejected. When I tried in the player in my room it loaded, however the film was constantly jumping and jittering.

I mean what could he have been possibly thinking!! As a established big-time fan of his work and vision this movie was without a doubt the \\"BIGGEST MISTAKE OF DARIO ARGENTO\'S CAREER\\"! When I had heard about it being the one of the few chances I would get to see his lesser-known daughter Fiore Argento, Also when I heard that Stunningly Beautiful, Ageless, and JUST PLAIN HOT!! To say noyhing of very talented Jennifer Connelly was going to be in it as well as \\"Halloween\\" star Donald Pleasance all starring in it plus an original concept like someone who can communicate with bugs telepathically I thought how could Dario possibly go wrong here?! Well guess what He did everything horribly wrong! First of all we only see his other daughter Fiore for like maybe the first 4 minutes of the movie,when her character misses some tour bus or something and comes by some waterfall outlook point,has no real lines, and to make matters worse gets to be the murderers first victim!(some part she had!) Well anyway I tried to shrug it off and go on. So from there we meet Jennifer Connelly\'s character who\'s name is also Jennifer(GEEZ! how creative, LOL!)And is some rich attorney\'s princess whom he sends to some Swiss boarding school.  And to make an long story short she meets her roommate who secretly has a boyfriend and is not the nice excepting friend she believes her to be \'cause behind her back her roommate and her roommates boyfriend laugh at her! And for what it\'s worth I feel that this \\"outcast who has a special secret  be it a supernatural power or whatever is something that\'s becoming quite tiresome! Not to mention that the part of the other girls being snobs against her(in particular when they and the \\"B***h on Wheels teacher snoop around and find out her secret via a letter intended for her father)didn\'t even come up until considerably later! Anyway for some reason she has this ability and isn\'t quite sure how to use it or control it right. Eventually she meets and befriends Donald Pleasance\'s character who\'s a wheelchair bound scientist who studies bugs. As they get to know eachother more he somehow(of course)understands her bug telepathy better than Jennifer does! WHAT?!! And he allows her not only the knowledge of how the bugs can help her find the murderer but also a fly to help her(of which for some reason he refers to as \\"The Great Sarcophagus!) Again What?! A Sarcophagus is an Egyptian Mummy\'s coffin.What the HELL has that got to do with a fly! If it was a beetle that would make sense but not a fly! So the wicked boarding school teacher tries to commit her because she I guess doubts her ability to commune with bugs. Which presented the only cool scene as far as I\'m concerned where she has a lot flies come to the windows and doors of the boarding house and with an angelic glimmer and the keen theme tune playing utters the words\\" I Love You All\\" to the flies and then faints! Needless to say after she has a completely corny easy time escaping she attempts to get a plain ticket out of Switzerland and upon failing to do so the only person at the school who was nice to her played by Argento\'s now ex-wife Daria Nicolodi giving Jennifer somewhere to stay at her house! I won\'t bore you all with too many details only that to my chagrin it wasn\'t bad enough Donald Pleasance\'s untimely death at the hands of the killer but to make matters worse get this DARIA NICOLODI\'s CHARACTER WAS THE KILLER THE WHOLE TIME! Not to mention Daria\'s character ending up being dull, bland and ONE-DIMENSIOAL! On top of that you already know she\'s the killer 90 minutes into the movie when there\'s still 15 minutes to go! Not to mention her deformed son(who quite frankly looked like a pig on acid)had some part in it!Gosh what an ugly FREAK! One bigger problem here is that that guy she left chained to the wall was neither explained nor developed as a character!I mean who was he? I also hate that Jennifer Connely\'s character has this  control over bugs yet when Daria attempts to poison her and also when she chases after her she stupidly does not use her powers until the deformed son corners her on the motor boat! And a bigger shocker is Donald\'s lab monkey saving her by insanely slashing at Daria with an old fashioned razor blade which was quite disturbing!  Anyway other than that I got sick and tired of looking at maggots all the time!I hate them! So in closing this movie lacked miserably in nudity,pretty colors like Dario has used in his other movies and it had a couple of annoying aforementioned plot holes! So in closing if you enjoyed Dario Argento\'s other movies such as the Three Mothers Trilogy(Suspiria,Inferno, and Mother of Tears)Do You Like Hitchcock? or Tenebre as much as I did then definitely skip this morbid Half-A***ed diarrhea on celluloid like the plague!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Phenomena wasn\'t terribly PHENOMENAL!

Sheppard", "helpful": [32, 41], "reviewText": "When the original \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" series was in development in the 1970s, script editor Alfred Shaughnessy provided guidelines for the writers.  This one was pivotal: \\"Television is electronic theatre and not second-rate film.\\"  The new series also called - minus the comma - \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" ignores this guideline.  The result is an indifferent second-rate film that would not get more than a passing glance if it were not for the title, which is a fraudulent attempt to sell itself by connecting with the wildly successful original.It is also tries to make the connection by taking us to 165 Eaton Place, the Bellamy townhouse in the original Up/Down, left in 1930 and vacant ever since.  When we arrive at 165 with the new owners in 1936, the very first shot shows clearly that it is not the same townhouse - the pillars framing the portico are fluted rather than plain and a double door opens into the hall, where the original had a single front door.  Inside, the hall is dominated by a chandelier that was not there before.  The door leading to the servants\' area has changed color in the six years the house was unoccupied, and a small diamond-shaped window has appeared in it.  The new owners order extensive renovations, but the lavish result would not have fit inside the original townhouse.  This 165 Eaton Place would require the dimensions of a mansion to accommodate the upstairs changes.  Downstairs, the servants\' quarters also bear no resemblance to the original before or after renovation.The original Up/Down rarely left the townhouse.  It focused on the characters and their development and interactions, sometimes influenced by events in the real world.  Each episode tended to be centered on only one or two characters, and scenes ran for the five or ten or twenty minutes needed to create \\"theatre.\\"  Watching them, you got to know and become interested in the achievements and problems of the characters as people.  Music was used in a scene only when it came from an on-screen source - a phonograph, an off-screen band, etc.The new Up/Down has a short attention span.  It jumps all over the house and London, and it\'s very involved with events in the real world.  By concentrating on those events, the scripts are too superficial to make you care what happens to the characters.  And this Up/Down is cursed with virtually continuous background music that is frequently intrusive and often loud enough to interfere with the dialogue.The original Up/Down was conceived by Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, who provide another tenuous connection to it by appearing in this sad reincarnation.  We know that they are splendid actresses from their work elsewhere.  Here Marsh is wasted as the colorless housekeeper and Atkins\'s character has only one note, sarcastic bossiness.  There is no way to judge the acting abilities of the rest of the cast, which often seems to be on automatic pilot.The BBC has commissioned another six episodes of the new Up/Down.  That\'s fewer than half of a usual series and suggests the Beeb is not completely happy with the first series.  It could encourage the new episodes to be electronic theatre by limiting the production to three or four locations inside 165 Eaton Place to force the writer, Heidi Thomas, to populate her scripts with real characters and their relationships with each other, whether upstairs or downstairs, and having only minimal connection to real world events.I always looked forward to seeing each episode of the original \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" in its broadcasts from my local PBS station and still do now in repeats from DVDs.The new incarnation has nothing to make me want to watch it again.  I can\'t give it no stars, so I give it one star for effrontery.Addition, August 23, 2011: a BBC press release posted on the Upstairs Downstairs website says that Eileen Atkins has left the cast of the new episodes.  She \\"is reportedly unhappy with the direction the new scripts are taking.\\"", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Fraudulent", "unixReviewTime": 1306368000, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2011"}\n',

Wouldn\'t Charlotte Bronte be appalled!It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane\'s experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter\'s rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn\'t seem to relish the fact that she\'s supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.Don\'t look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane\'s originality.It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to \\"The governess,\\"while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness.In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester\'s brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman\'s cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can\'t get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who\'s marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:\\"So you didn\'t find anyone else to marry you?\\" sneers Rochester.\\"I found someone who wanted to marry me.\\" again, the self-satisfied smile.Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "\\"Do you approve Mrs. Fairfax?\\" \\"Here, take my blue pin.\\"", "unixReviewTime": 1128470400, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2005"}\n',

How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciar&agrave;n Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane\'s character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton\'s Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciar&agrave;n Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester\'s character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciar&agrave;n Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Ad&egrave;le, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront\'s brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter\'s own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: \\"I know it may sound silly but....\\" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront\'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront\'s Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront\'s Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic\'s room to sniff at Mason\'s wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.Equally lamentable is the filmmakers\' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot.

ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:Fox should be ashamed of what it has done to these movies!  All eight of these movies are presented as being \\"wide screen\\".  However, for most of them this is achieved by removing the top and bottom of the old full screen image.I compared all eight of these DVDs to the VHS releases, and found that five of the movies have been cropped to make them appear \\"widescreen\\".  The VHS formats are in a 16 x 12 ratio (the proportaions of the old-fashioned standard US TV screen).  Fox has removed the top eighth and bottom eighth of each movie to make them fill the new 16 x 9 ratio widescreen TVs.  The following five movies in this set have been cropped:  Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, Silent Movie, To Be or Not To Be, Robin Hood.  The DVDs in this set present only 3/4 of the image that was shown on the old VHS releases.The other three (Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, History of the World, Part 1) appear to be true wide-screen releases.  The DVDs show the full picture from the VHS releases, but wider.When will studios understand that what most buyers want is the full image of the original movie, regardless of its proportions?

This film was an exception. I could forgive its lack of plot, its lifeless acting, its stilted dialogue, and the utter lack of chemistry between Pablo and Sally - but I simply could not forgive the awful dancing. Face it, Potter is a zombie on the dance floor. She has no energy, no spark, no fluidity. Veron had enough verve for the two of them (and it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for Veron to show off), but that does not compensate for his completely unconvincing dance partner. Why would anyone doing performance tango (which, by the way, absolutely cannot be learned after a lesson in \\"walking\\" and a trip to Buenos Aires) choose a marionette for a partner?

I makes no sense, an Indiana Jones rip-off & Godzilla gets teamed up on.

How could you possibly make sense of a film like this?  Steven Spielberg really messed up this time around, making a movie about space and yet most of it takes place on earth.  Duh...what kind of science fiction movie takes place on Earth in the 1970s?  This one, I guess.If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you\'ll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don\'t know why they\'re considered so revolutionary because they\'re not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that\'s what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.  Apparently in Steven Spielberg\'s mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)The best thing about this movie is that it ends (sadly after 6 1/2 hours of people climbing on mountains and staring into the sky).

I really like the scene on the highway near the train tracks and The chase,*SPOILER*but really \\"Roy\\" is such a jerk and leaves to join the mothership? I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting \\"If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?\\" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn\'t come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this. And the end of this movie totally killed it for me.See for yourself whether you agree or disagree with my review.it\'s not a bad movie  but certainly could have been better.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind.", "unixReviewTime": 1277769600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2010"}\n'
