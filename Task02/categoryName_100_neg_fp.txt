From the amazing full concert footage, to the haunting Grace Electronic Press Kit, this DVD is a must  have for all Buckley fans.  We get to see a glimpse of Jeff in an intimate  club setting and it\'s really nice to have captured that moment and to be  able to go back to it, and be amazed over and over.  It is truly a sad and  beautiful thing all at once.  I urge all music lovers to give Jeff Buckley  a listen, and try not to be impressed.  The only thing that I would have  also included, would have been all of Jeff\'s videos.  Other than that, this  is perfect.

This performane is taped in 80th, but still, the power and magic of my favourite conductor can be clearly seen. He is demanding, he is precise and unbelievable. First of all he is responsible for the staging of this &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and one can see that the staging is superb. Nothing has espaced through Karajan\'s attention, every single detail is so correct. And watch to the scene when commendatore comes to Don Giovanni\'s house, the idea of taking Don Giovanni with him to the stars is new (we all know that Don Giovanni is going to burn in the hell, so he is not supposed to go up to the sky, he must go down to the hell), but really breathtaking, I wish I attended this performance live to see how it looks in the opera-house.What about performers? They are outstanding. Samuel Ramey is splendid, perfect Don Giovanni, Furlanetto is terrific Leporello and of course Paata Burchuladze\'s voice is so great, I saw him singing Leporello, he was unbelievable, here he sings Commendatore and he is really great.This is must have &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, you can not find &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; of the same level.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "His Majesty Herbert Von Karajan!", "unixReviewTime": 1004486400, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2001"}\n',

I\'ve known Theodora for many years and was aware of the fact that Handel thought it was one of his best works. When I sat down to watch this (on regular DVD the first time round), I was blown away with the intensity of everyone involved. The Orchestra of the Enlightenment under William Christie play immaculately. The singers are a class by themselves. David Daniels\' beautiful countertenor is used to maximum effect and his involvement is total. So is Dawn Upshaw\'s performance a tour de force. Lorraine Hunt Lieberson gives us a portrayal that will leave you breathless. The staging is thankfully as unobtrusive as possible and did not annoy. I could have done without the silly arm and finger movements but you get used to it fast enough. In the original revue one critic wrote: &#34;the audience sat as if stunned&#34;. Another reviewer was not too pleased with the fact that all the principals involved but one, as well as the conductor, were  American. And that on British soil! I have never seen an opera production (although this is not an opera) that has satisfied so much over a long time. The new Blu-Ray DVD is of much better picture quality, while the sound is first-rate.
